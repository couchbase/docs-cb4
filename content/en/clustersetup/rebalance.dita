  <title>Rebalancing a Cluster</title><shortdesc>Rebalancing represents a process of re-distributing information among the available nodes and 
    updating the corresponding vBucket map to reflect the new structure.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>As you operate your Couchbase Server cluster, you might need to alter the number of nodes in the cluster 
      to cope with changes in application load, RAM, disk I/O and network performance requirements.</p>
      
      <p>Data is stored and distributed within a cluster through the vBucket structure. 
      When your Couchbase Server cluster expands or shrinks, the information stored in the vBuckets 
      is redistributed among the available nodes, and the corresponding vBucket map is updated to reflect the new structure. 
      This process is called <term>rebalancing</term>.</p>
      
      <p>The rebalancing process can take place while the cluster is running and servicing requests.
      Clients using the cluster read and write to the existing structure while the data is moving in
      the background among nodes. Once the moving process is completed, the vBucket map is updated
      and communicated to the smart clients and the proxy service (Moxi).</p>
    <p>For more information about rebalancing, see <xref
        href="https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/doc/rebalance-flow.txt"

    <section><title>Rebalance Operation</title>
      <p>A new inactive vBucket is created on the intended destination node.  The data is copied from the current active vBucket to the new vBucket.  
        New replica copies are made from the original vBucket if necessary.</p>
        <p>Rebalancing exchanges the data held on each node across the cluster and has two effects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removes the data from the nodes that are removed from the cluster. 
            By totally removing the storage of data on these nodes, the nodes can be taken out 
            of the cluster without affecting the cluster operation.</li>
          <li>Adds the data and enables new nodes so that they can serve information to clients. 
            By moving active data to the new nodes, these nodes become responsible for the moved 
            vBuckets and for servicing client requests.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Rebalancing moves both the data stored in RAM and on disk, 1 vBucket at a time by default, 
        which applies to each Bucket and each node within the cluster. The time taken for the move 
        depends on the level of cluster activity, network congestion, disk speed and the size of each vBucket.</p>
        <p>During rebalance, the cluster remains up and continues to service and handle client requests. 
        Updates and changes to the stored data during the migration process are tracked and will be 
        updated and migrated with the data that existed when the rebalance was requested.</p>
       <p>When the vBucket has moved, and the new one is up-to-date, there is an atomic takeover by
        the node that now owns the vBucket. This is also the moment in time when the cluster map is
        updated and pushed to each client SDK. If a client SDK attempts an operation in that
        millisecond after the atomic takeover but before receiving the new cluster map, the SDK will
        receive an error <codeph>NOT_MY_VBUCKET</codeph> as well as a new copy of the cluster map.
        The SDK will then reconnect to retry the operation to the new node automatically, with no
        extra code from the developer. This process happens while each vBucket has moved during a
        rebalance. </p>
      <p>The updated vBucket map is communicated to the Couchbase SDK client libraries and the
        enabled smart clients (such as Moxi) and allows clients to use the updated structure as the
        rebalance completes. The new structure is used as soon as possible to help spread and even
        out the load during the rebalance operation. </p>
      <p>Because the cluster stays up and active throughout the entire rebalancing process, 
        clients can continue to store and retrieve information and do not need to be aware that 
        a rebalance operation is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>There are four common reasons to perform a rebalance operation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding nodes to expand the cluster size.</li>
    <li>Removing nodes to reduce the cluster size.</li>
    <li>Reacting to a failover situation, where you need to bring the cluster back to a healthy state. See Recovering failed over nodes.</li>
    <li>Temporarily removing one or more nodes to perform a software, operating system, or hardware
          maintenance.</li>
  </ul>

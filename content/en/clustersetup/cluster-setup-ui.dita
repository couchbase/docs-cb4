    Console, you can optionally configure other settings, such as the port and RAM, using CLI or

  <section><title>Cluster setup using the Couchbase Web Console</title>
    <p>The default location of the Couchbase Web Console is
      <codeph>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8091</codeph></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Couchbase Web Console. </li>
      <li>Click <uicontrol>Setup</uicontrol> to begin the initial configuration. <p><image
        href="../admin/picts/cluster-setup-01.png" id="image_wmt_pbd_dt" align="left"/></p></li>
      <li>Set up the disk storage and Data service. <p>The <wintitle>Configure Disk
            Storage</wintitle> option specifies the location of the persistent storage used by the
          Couchbase Server Data service. The setting affects only this node and sets the directory
          where all the data is stored on disk. It also sets the location where the indexes created
          by views are stored:</p><ul>
          <li>If you are not indexing data with views, you can accept the default setting. Otherwise
            for the best performance we recommend specifying separate physical storage for the data
            and index paths. </li>
          <li>The <wintitle>Configure Server Memory</wintitle> section sets the amount of physical
            RAM that will be allocated by Couchbase Server for storage.</li>
          <li>If you are creating a new cluster, this is the amount of memory that is allocated on
            each node within your Couchbase cluster. The same amount of memory is allocated to each
            node in the cluster. Since the same setting applies to the whole cluster, specify a
            value that can be supported by all nodes. </li>
        </ul></li>
       <li> Provide a node IP or hostname under <wintitle>Configure Server
         Hostname</wintitle>. </li>
      <li>Choose which <xref href="../concepts/multidimensional-scaling.dita#concept_ckt_svy_zs"
          >services</xref> to include on the first node. At a minimum, the Data service is required.
        In production, only one service per node should be deployed. </li> 
      <li>The <wintitle>Configure Server Memory</wintitle> section sets the amount of physical RAM
        that will be allocated by the Couchbase Server for storage, both for the Data and the Index
        service. The same amount of memory is allocated to each node in the cluster that runs the
        particular service. Since the same setting applies to the whole cluster, specify a value
        that all nodes of each service type can support. <p>Alternatively, if joining an existing
          cluster, select the radio button <uicontrol>Join a cluster now</uicontrol> and then
          provide the IP address or hostname of an existing node and administrative credentials for
          that existing cluster. Select the services to install on this node. </p></li> 
      <li>Click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>.
        <p>The <wintitle>Sample Buckets</wintitle> panel appears where you can select the sample data buckets you want to load.</p></li>
      <li>Click the names of sample buckets to load to the Couchbase Server. These data sets
        demonstrate Couchbase Server's features and help you understand and develop views and N1QL
        Queries. <p>If you decide to install sample data, the installer creates one Couchbase bucket
          for each set of sample data you choose. </p><p><image
            href="../admin/picts/cluster-setup-02.png" id="image_cst_vfd_dt" align="left"/></p>
        <p> After you create sample data buckets, the <wintitle>Create Bucket</wintitle> panel
          appears where you create a new default data bucket.</p></li>
      <li>Set up a test bucket for Couchbase Server. You can change all bucket settings later, except for the bucket name.</li>
      <li>Accept all defaults in this panel.
        <p>Couchbase Server will create a new data bucket named <codeph>default</codeph>. 
          You can use this test bucket to learn more about Couchbase Server and use it in a test environment.</p></li>
      <li>Select <uicontrol>Enable software update notifications</uicontrol>. Couchbase Web Console
        communicates with Couchbase Server nodes and confirms the version numbers of each node.
        <p>As long as you have Internet access this information will be sent anonymously to
          Couchbase corporate, which uses this information only to provide you with updates and
          information to help improve Couchbase Server and related products. When you provide an
          email address, it is added to the Couchbase community mailing list for news and update
          information about Couchbase and related products. You can unsubscribe from the mailing
          list at any time using the Unsubscribe link provided in each newsletter.</p>
        Couchbase Web Console communicates the following information: <ul>
          <li>The current version. When a new version of Couchbase Server exists, you get
            information about where you can download the new version.</li>
          <li>Information about the size and configuration of your Couchbase cluster to Couchbase
            corporate. This information helps prioritize the development efforts.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Read the terms and conditions and then select <codeph>I agree to the terms and conditions
          associated with this product</codeph> and click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>.</li>
      <li>Enter a cluster administrator's username and password. Your username can have up to 24 characters, and your password must have 6 to 24 characters. 
        Use these credentials each time you add a new server into the cluster. These are the same credentials you use for Couchbase Server REST API.</li>
      <li>After you finish this setup, you see the Couchbase Web Console with the Cluster Overview page. Couchbase Server is now running and ready to use.

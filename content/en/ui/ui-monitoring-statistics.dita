 <title>Monitoring statistics</title>
 <shortdesc>Within the <uicontrol>Data Buckets</uicontrol> tab, information and statistics about
  buckets and nodes are displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster. The information is
  aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected
  bucket.</shortdesc>

  <note type="note">The information for each item is available when you click on the
   blue triangle on the right side of the stats window.</note>

   <p><image href="../images/ui-databucket-stats.png" id="image_x3y_bt4_1s" align="left" width="720"
    /></p>The Data Buckets section displays the general analytics data for a selected bucket. <p>On
    the top, there are two dropdown lists that let you select the bucket itself and the specific
    server node (or all nodes) from where the information will be collected. </p><p>The Interval
    Selection changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page. For example, selecting
    Minute shows information for the last minute, continuously updating. As the selected interval
    increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long your cluster has
    been running. </p></section>
  
  
  <section><title>Server resources</title>
    <p>The Server resources section displays information about RAM utilization, streaming requests,
     and so on.</p>

  <section><title>Summary</title><p>The Summary section is designed to provide a quick overview of
     the cluster activity. Each graph (or selected graph) shows information based on the currently
     selected bucket.</p>
    <image href="../images/web-console-server-stats-summary.png" width="720"/>
    <p>The following graph types are available:</p><dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>ops per second</dt>
      <dd>The total number of operations per second on this bucket.</dd>
     </dlentry>

      href="../images/web-console-server-stats-vbucket.png" id="image_jjl_lmq_yr" align="left"
      width="720"/></p>The vBucket statistics provide information for all vBucket types within the
    cluster across three different states. Within the statistic display, the table of statistics is
    organized in four columns, showing the Active, Replica and Pending states for each statistic.
    The final column provides the total value for each statistics. <p>The Active column displays the
     information for vBuckets within the Active state. The Replica column displays the statistics
     for vBuckets within the Replica state (that is currently being replicated). The Pending columns
     shows statistics for vBuckets in the Pending state; that is while data is being exchanged
     during rebalancing.</p></section>

    <p> The Disk Queues statistics section displays the information for data being placed into the
     disk queue. Disk queues are used within Couchbase Server to store the information written to
     RAM on disk for persistence. Information is displayed for each of the disk queue states:
     Active, Replica, and Pending. </p>

  <section><title>TAP queues</title><p>The TAP queues statistics are designed to show information
    about the TAP queue activity, both internally, between cluster nodes and clients. The statistics
    information is organized as a table with columns showing the statistics for TAP queues used for
    replication, rebalancing, and clients.</p>

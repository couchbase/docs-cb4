  <title>Auto-Compaction</title><shortdesc>Auto-compaction configures the default settings for all databases. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You can override the default auto-compaction settings using per-bucket settings that are
      available when creating or editing data buckets. You can provide a purge interval to remove
      the key and metadata for items that have been deleted or are expired, which is known as
        <term>tombstone purging</term>. </p>

              <p>Defaults to three days. Tombstones are records of expired or deleted items and they
                include the key and metadata. Tombstones are used in Couchbase Server to provide
                eventual consistency of data between clusters.</p>
              <p>The auto-compaction process waits this number of days before it permanently deletes
                tombstones for expired or deleted items. </p>
              <p>If you set this value too low, you may see more inconsistent results in views
                queries such as deleted items in a result set. You may also see inconsistent items
                in clusters with XDCR set up between the clusters. If you set this value too high,
                it will delay the server from reclaiming disk space.</p>

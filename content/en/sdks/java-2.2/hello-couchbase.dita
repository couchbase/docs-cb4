    <title>Hello Couchbase Example</title><shortdesc>Now that you added the SDK dependency to your project, you can proceed and implement the classic "Hello World" example.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>

        <p>Some important aspects are also covered along the way that will help you later.</p>

        <p>The first thing you need to do is connect to the cluster:</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java">Cluster cluster = CouchbaseCluster.create();</codeblock>

        <p>With no other arguments provided, this connection will logically bind to a cluster where
            the cluster is reachable on <codeph>localhost</codeph>. This type of connection is a
            reasonable default to get started during development, but in production you should pass
            in more seed nodes like this:</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java">Cluster cluster = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.56.101", "192.168.56.102");</codeblock>

        <p>You do not need to pass in all nodes of the cluster, just a few seed nodes so that the
            client can establish the initial contact. The actual process of connecting to a bucket
            (that is, opening sockets and everything related) happens when you call the
                <codeph>openBucket</codeph> method:</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Bucket bucket = cluster.openBucket();]]></codeblock>

        <p>This will connect to the <codeph>default</codeph> bucket and return a <codeph>Bucket</codeph> reference.</p>

        <p>If you want to connect to a different bucket (also with a password), you can do it like this:</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Bucket bucket = cluster.openBucket("bucket", "password");]]></codeblock>

        <p>When your application shuts down, you need to make sure to disconnect properly from the
            cluster to free all resources (sockets, threads, and so on). The following code shuts
            down the client:</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java">cluster.disconnect();</codeblock>

        <p>This disconnects all buckets and makes the associated resources available.</p>

        <p>You now have a reference to the <codeph>Bucket</codeph>, so you can begin working with it. The SDK comes with built-in handling for JSON documents, which you can use right away. First, create a <codeph>JsonObject</codeph>, which contains information for a user.</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java">JsonObject user = JsonObject.empty()
    .put("firstname", "Walter")
    .put("lastname", "White")
    .put("job", "chemistry teacher")
    .put("age", 50);</codeblock>

        <p>A <codeph>JsonObject</codeph> works very much like a <codeph>Map</codeph>, but it is designed to only let you insert values that can be stored as valid JSON (including nested objects and arrays). The resulting document looks like this:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-json">{
    "firstname":"Walter",
    "job":"chemistry teacher",
    "age":50,
    "lastname":"White"
}</codeblock>

        <p>To store the document, you can use the <codeph>upsert</codeph> method on the <codeph>bucket</codeph>. Because a document on the server has more properties than just the content, you need to give it at least a unique document ID (for example, <codeph>walter</codeph>). The container for all this information is called a <codeph>Document</codeph> and because you are dealing with JSON you need to create a <codeph>JsonDocument</codeph>:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[JsonDocument doc = JsonDocument.create("walter", user);
JsonDocument response = bucket.upsert(doc);]]></codeblock>

        <p>The <codeph>Document</codeph> is automatically converted into JSON and stored on the cluster. If the document (identified by its unique ID) already exists, it is replaced.</p>

        <p>If you replace <codeph>upsert</codeph> with <codeph>insert</codeph> and try to insert the same document twice (with the same ID), you see the following:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Exception in thread "main" com.couchbase.client.java.error.DocumentAlreadyExistsException
    at com.couchbase.client.java.CouchbaseAsyncBucket$12.call(CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java:425)
    at com.couchbase.client.java.CouchbaseAsyncBucket$12.call(CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java:409)
    ...]]></codeblock>

        <p>This provides an important clue:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><codeph>insert</codeph>, unlike <codeph>upsert</codeph> fails if the document already exists on the server (very much like the SQL <codeph>INSERT</codeph>
              statement).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Not surprisingly, you can also retrieve a <codeph>Document</codeph> from the database. You do this by providing its ID:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[JsonDocument walter = bucket.get("walter");
System.out.println("Found: " + walter);]]></codeblock>

        <p>This prints:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Found: JsonDocument{id='walter', cas=16976883046781, expiry=0, content={"firstname":"Walter","job":"chemistry teacher","age":50,"lastname":"White"}}]]></codeblock>

        <p>If you want to print only the age, you can reach into the content (much like you would access a `Map`):</p>

        <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[System.out.println("Age: " + walter.content().getInt("age"));]]></codeblock>

        <p>You can combine both commands to implement something that is needed very often: loading a document, modifying
			its content and then storing the modified document.</p>

        <p>First, here is one of the possible way to do it synchronously:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[JsonDocument loaded = bucket.get("walter");
if (loaded == null) {
    System.err.println("Document not found!");
} else {
    loaded.content().put("age", 52);
    JsonDocument updated = bucket.replace(loaded);
    System.out.println("Updated: " + updated.id());
}]]></codeblock>

        <p>The code uses the <codeph>get</codeph> method to load the <codeph>Document</codeph> and
            then waits until it arrives from the server (returns <codeph>null</codeph> as the default
            value if it does not exist). If it is not null, the content is modified and the document is
            stored again through the synchronous <codeph>replace</codeph> method. You can think of
                <codeph>replace</codeph> as the opposite of <codeph>insert</codeph>â€”if the document does
            not already exist, the call will fail with a <codeph>DocumentDoesNotExistException</codeph>.</p>

        <p>The code shown above is completely synchronous, which means that your main thread will
            wait all the time until a response comes back from the server. It waits for network IO
            to happen while instead it could perform valuable work. Instead of waiting and "pulling"
            the data out of the SDK, you can just keep going forward in your application flow and
            let the SDK notify you once it's done with work.</p>

        <p><codeph>Observable</codeph>s provide a large range of methods and functionality to
            create, combine and transform asynchronous workflows and make them look synchronous
            (while they aren't). Other approaches quickly get you into "callback hell" and are
            complicated dealing with futures, especially if you want to chain more than one
            asynchronous operation together, let alone proper error handling.</p>

        <p>Here is the very same example, but completely non-blocking (note that you want to keep your main thread alive with a <codeph>Thread.sleep()</codeph> for now or use <codeph>CountDownLatch</codeph>):</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[bucket
    .async()
    .get("walter")
    .flatMap(new Func1<JsonDocument, Observable<JsonDocument>>() {
        @Override
        public Observable<JsonDocument> call(final JsonDocument loaded) {
            loaded.content().put("age", 52);
            return bucket.async().replace(loaded);
        }
    })
    .subscribe(new Action1<JsonDocument>() {
        @Override
        public void call(final JsonDocument updated) {
            System.out.println("Updated: " + updated.id());
        }
    });]]></codeblock>

        <p>Note how you can get access to the underlying asynchronous interfaces by using the <codeph>async()</codeph> method on the bucket.</p>

        <p>Without going too much in-depth about how <codeph>Observables</codeph> work just yet, it
            is not too hard to guess what is happening. The document is loaded through the
                <codeph>get</codeph> method, and after it is done, the <codeph>flatMap</codeph>
            method is executed. This method changes the content and calls the
                <codeph>replace</codeph> method. After the replace is done, the
                <codeph>Subscriber</codeph> is called, and the line is printed. You do not need to
            check for <codeph>null</codeph> here because the whole chain is just not executed if the
            document is not found in the first place.</p>

        <p>The style shown above is Java6/7 with anonymous classes. If you are already using Java 8, you can replace the same code with lambdas to make it much nicer and succinct:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[bucket
    .async()
    .get("walter")
    .flatMap(loaded -> {
        loaded.content().put("age", 52);
        return bucket.async().replace(loaded);
    })
    .subscribe(updated -> System.out.println("Updated: " + updated.id()));]]></codeblock>

        <p>Because this flow is asynchronous, every "callback" is run in a specific thread,
            different from the one you were executing the call (at this point most likely <codeph>main</codeph>). Since this one-off example is different from long-running server applications (which are not shut down after one operation), it is a good idea to
            synchronize and wait after the last operation is finished.</p>

        <p>A naive way is to add a <codeph>Thread.sleep(1000)</codeph> after the last call to keep the current thread alive for a second and hope that the operation is done:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[bucket
    .async()
    .get("walter")
    .flatMap(loaded -> {
        loaded.content().put("age", 52);
        return bucket.async().replace(loaded);
    })
    .subscribe(updated -> System.out.println("Updated: " + updated.id()));

Thread.sleep(1000);]]></codeblock>

        <p>Usually, it takes a shorter amount of time, so you are just wasting time. And in the
            unlikely case that it takes longer, it doesn't work properly. So a better way is the use
            of a <codeph>CountDownLatch</codeph>, which ships with the JDK. One thread counts it
            down and the other waits until its counted down:</p>


<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
bucket
    .async()
    .get("walter")
    .flatMap(loaded -> {
        loaded.content().put("age", 52);
        return bucket.async().replace(loaded);
    })
    .subscribe(
        System.out::println,
        err -> {
            err.printStackTrace();
            latch.countDown();
        },
        latch::countDown
    );

latch.await();]]></codeblock>

        <p>The example shows a better, if not a perfect solution. Because your subscriber (the
            callbacks) is called from a different thread, without more changes on your side, you do
            not have access to either the computed values or the error that is thrown.  You can work
            around that by using atomic variables from the concurrent package, but thankfully RxJava
            has you covered as well. You can use the <codeph>toBlocking</codeph> methods, which will
            return you the result(s) in a blocking fashion, as well as propagate any errors of the
            flow as exceptions to your calling thread:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[JsonDocument result = bucket
    .async()
    .get("walter")
    .flatMap(loaded -> {
        loaded.content().put("age", 52);
        return bucket.async().replace(loaded);
    })
    .toBlocking()
    .single();]]></codeblock>

        <p>So remember that instead of using latches, always use <codeph>toBlocking</codeph> and its
			different ways to extract the data. You can learn more about that in <xref
				href="observables.dita#concept2677" />.</p>

		<p>In <codeph>Couchbase 4.0</codeph>, a new query language has been introduced: N1QL. Since it is
            a superset of SQL, we can write a Hello World example using N1QL.  Make sure to have the
            query service activated in your cluster and a primary index created on your bucket. See
                <xref href="../../developer-guide/querying.dita"/>):</p>

	    <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[String statement = "SELECT firstname FROM `default` WHERE age BETWEEN 49 AND 59";
N1qlQuery query = N1qlQuery.simple(statement);
N1qlQueryResult result = bucket.query(query);
System.out.println("Hello, users in their fifties: ");
for (N1qlQueryRow row : result)
{ String firstName = row.value().getString("firstname"); System.out.println(firstName + "!"); }
//prints:
// â€œHello, users in their fifties:
// Walter!"]]></codeblock>

		<p>For the statement, you can alternatively use the DSL:</p>
<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Statement statement = Select.select(x("firstname")).from(i("default"))
	.where(x("age").between(49).and(59));
N1qlQuery query = N1qlQuery.simple(statement);]]></codeblock>

        <p>Congratulations, you've completed your first steps towards Couchbase mastery! At this
            point, you can either proceed with the complete tutorial application or browse through the
            rest of the documentation as you see fit.</p>

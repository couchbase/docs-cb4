 <title>Performance tuning</title>
 <shortdesc>Follow the guidelines to effectively use your computing resources.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Though the Go SDK and Couchbase Server are extremely performant, you can follow these
   guidelines to ensure the most effective use of your computing resources:</p>
  <ul id="ol_abl_mwq_t4">
   <li>Couchbase bucket connections are relatively expensive to establish compared to the operations
    performed on them. Therefore, you should open each bucket only once per application instance.
    Due to multiplexing performed within the SDK, opening multiple connections can cause issues and
    will not benefit performance in most cases.</li>
   <li>Don't use too many views and buckets. A large number of buckets or views can negatively
				affect the performance of Couchbase Server and any connected clients.</li>
   <li>Performing multiple operations simultaneously increases throughput and is important to
    achieve the best possible operation speeds. This is possible by using the
     <codeph>BulkOp</codeph> structures along with the <codeph>Do</codeph> method of a Bucket. These
    structures and method allow you to build a list of operations to perform, and execute them
    simultaneously (though not atomically).</li>
  </ul>

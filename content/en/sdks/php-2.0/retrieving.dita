			<title>Regular reads </title>
			
			<p>You perform regular reads by using the <codeph>get()</codeph> method. Regular reads enable you
				to retrieve a previously stored document from your active data set. </p>
			<p>The following example shows a regular read:</p>
			<codeblock outputclass="language-php">$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket();
$res = $myBucket->get(‘document_name’);
var_dump($res);</codeblock>
			
			<p>Sample output from the example:</p>
			<codeblock>object(CouchbaseMetaDoc)#4 (4) {
  ["value"]=>
  array(1) {
    ["name"]=>
    string(5) "Frank"
  }
  ["flags"]=>
  int(4)
  ["cas"]=>
  resource(5) of type (CAS)
}</codeblock>

		<section>
			<title>Replica reads</title>
			<p>You perform replica reads by using the <codeph>getReplica()</codeph> method. Replica reads
				enable you to retrieve a previously stored document by querying the replica copies of
				this document rather than the active one. This is not guaranteed to be consistent, but
				does permit a level of recovery in case the primary server is not reachable.</p>

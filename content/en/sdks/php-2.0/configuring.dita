 <title>Configuring the client</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
		<p>To configure the client, instantiate a new <codeph>Cluster</codeph> object:</p>
  <codeblock>var couchbase = require('couchbase');
var myCluster = new couchbase.Cluster('couchbase://10.4.4.1');</codeblock>
  <p>In addition to the connection string passed to the <codeph>Cluster</codeph> object, you can
			include a user name and password. The user name and password are required to perform
			management operations against your cluster. If you do not use the cluster management
			aspects of the SDK, the user name and password parameters are optional. Keep in mind that
			these credentials are the same ones you use to log in to the Couchbase administrator
			console, not those specified for the bucket itself. </p>

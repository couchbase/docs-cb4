	<title>Replica Reads</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>Replica reads are performed through the getReplica method. This allows you to retrieve a previously stored document by querying the replica copies of this document rather than the active one. This is not guaranteed to be consistent, but does permit a level of recovery in case the primary server is not reachable.</p>

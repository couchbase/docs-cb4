	<title>Getting Started</title><shortdesc>To get started with the SDK, install it on your computer and then try a simple example,
		Hello Couchbase.</shortdesc>

			<title>Installing the Node.js SDK</title>
			<p>Installing Couchnode is similar to installing most other Node.js modules. Use npm to
				install the <apiname>couchbase</apiname> module:</p>
			<codeblock outputclass="language-bash">$ npm install couchbase</codeblock>
			<p>
				<note>On non-Windows platforms, you must have <xref
						href="https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp" format="html"
						scope="external">node-gyp</xref> installed and a build environment available
					because the Couchbase SDK module takes advantage of V8 add-on capabilities
					(written in C/C++). On Windows, the module comes with prebuilt libraries.</note>
			</p>
			<!-- Although the Node.js SDK can be used as a standalone library, we suggest it be used with our ___child?___ ODM library known as Ottoman. -->

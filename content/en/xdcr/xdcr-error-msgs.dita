  <title>XDCR data security error messages</title> <shortdesc>Error messages will appear when the SSL certificates are different on the source and destination clusters.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>When creating the cluster reference, if the SSL certificates are not the same on the destination and source clusters, the following error message displays:
      
      <systemoutput>Attention - Got certificate mismatch while trying to send https request to HOST:18091</systemoutput></p>
      
      
      <p>The SSL certificates can become mismatched, such as when the certificate on the destination cluster is regenerated, 
      and the source cluster is not updated with the new certificate. 
      In this case, vBucket replication stops and the following error message displays:
      
     <systemoutput> Error replicating vbucket &lt;bucketNumber&gt;. Please see logs for details.</systemoutput></p>

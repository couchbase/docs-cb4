 <title>Smart data placement with rack and zone awareness</title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server buckets physically contain 1024 master and 0 or more replica vBuckets. The Cluster Manager master services module governs the placement of these vBuckets to maximize availability and rebalance performance.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Cluster Manager master services module calculates a vBucket map with heuristics to maximize availability and rebalance performance. The vBucket map is recalculated whenever the cluster topology changes. The following rules govern the vBucket map calculation: <ul>
   <li>Master and replica vBuckets are placed on separate nodes to protect against node failures. </li>
   <li>If a bucket is configured with more than 1 replica vBucket, each additional replica vBucket is placed on a separate node to provide better protection against node failures. </li>
   <li>If server groups are defined  for master vBuckets (such as rack and zone awareness capability),  the replica vBuckets are placed in a separate server group for better protection against rack or availability zone failures.</li>
  </ul></p>

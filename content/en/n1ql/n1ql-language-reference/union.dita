 <title>UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT</title>
 
 <conbody>
  
<p>UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT combine results from multiple subselects.</p>
 
<p>UNION returns values from the first and second subselects.</p>
  
<p>INTERSECT returns values that are present in both the first and second subselects. </p>
  
<p>EXCEPT returns values from the first subselect that are absent from the second subselect.</p>
  
<p>UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT return distinct results, such that there are no duplicates.</p>
  
<p> UNION ALL, INTERSECT ALL, and EXCEPT ALL return all applicable values, 
  including duplicates. These queries are faster, because they do not compute distinct results.</p>
   <p>You can improve the performance of a query by using covering indexes, where the index includes
      all the information needed to satisfy the query. For more information, see <xref
        href="../../developer-guide/covering-indexes.dita#concept_yv4_c2z_wt"/>.</p>

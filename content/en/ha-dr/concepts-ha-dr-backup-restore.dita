 <title>Backup and restore</title>
 <shortdesc> Backups protect against worst-case disaster situations and logical data corruption, such as an administrator accidentally deleting a bucket or a bug in the application. Backups can also be used to copy buckets for development, test or staging purposes. Couchbase Server supports zero-downtime backups and restores. Backups can be full, differential or cumulative, and Couchbase Server can restore any point to any bucket or topology. </shortdesc>

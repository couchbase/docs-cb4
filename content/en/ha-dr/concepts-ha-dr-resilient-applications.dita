 <title>Resilient applications</title>
 <shortdesc>Application design can also help improve resilience in the face of temporary or more permanent interruptions in node availability. For example, applications can be programmed to read from replicas and to automatically retry writes on alternate nodes, with timeouts set as low as 5 milliseconds. When using XDCR, an application can write to any cluster in a master-master replication scheme and the changes will be replicated to the other clusters.</shortdesc>

        <dt>Supported upgrade path</dt>
        <dd>The supported upgrade path for Couchbase Server is from one major version to the next.
          Upgrading from version 3.0.3 to version 4.0.0 is a supported, while upgrading from version
          2.5.2 to version 4.0.0 is not.</dd>

        <dt>Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDCR)</dt>
        <dd>To perform an upgrade, you can deploy a new cluster with the upgrade target version and
          then use XDCR to replicate bucket data from the existing cluster to the new cluster.
          <note type="important">Be sure to contact Couchbase Support for assistance with this style of upgrade.</note></dd>

        <dt> Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</dt>
        <dd>Data, query, and index workloads are all independently scalable in Couchbase Server
          version 4.0. You must consider all node service types when upgrading a cluster that uses
          multiple service types. <p>If your cluster uses multiple service types, upgrade each type in a rolling manner. 
            While upgrading, address only the nodes that support a given service to ensure that the service is 
            not disrupted during the upgrade. If the node has multiple services, also ensure that enough of 
            such nodes remain to service requests for the different services when upgrading.  </p>
          <p> Consider the following additional 
              points about MDS and node service types when planning your upgrade:</p><ul>
            <li> You cannot introduce additional node service types when adding a newly upgraded
              node to a cluster consisting of mixed version 3.x and 4.x nodes. If you attempt to
              upgrade a node to 4.x and introduce it back into the cluster with additional services
              checked prior to upgrading all nodes, you'll see a red warning similar to this:
                  <p><systemoutput>Attention - services parameter is not supported in this cluster
                  compatibility mode.</systemoutput></p></li>
            <li>If you are adding additional services to the nodes while upgrading, this can affect
              the Server RAM Quota, and you will be prompted to adjust it.</li>
          </ul></dd>

        <dt> Sync Gateway</dt>
        <dd>Take special precaution when upgrading Couchbase Server  if your cluster is used for
          replication through Sync Gateway. <p>Be aware that Sync Gateway (as of version 1.1.0) does
            not yet support the automatic handling of Couchbase Server cluster topology changes for
            related buckets. </p><p> If you plan to upgrade a Couchbase Server cluster used by the
            Sync Gateway versions less than or equal to 1.1.0, you must carefully coordinate manual
            reconfiguration of the Sync Gateway service between the key points in your upgrade
            process. </p><p>Updating Sync Gateway configuration manually to reflect changes in the
            cluster topology during an upgrade-related rebalancing is required to ensure that Sync
            Gateway can continue to connect to an active node. </p></dd>

        <dt>Community Edition to Enterprise Edition</dt>
        
        <dd>Version differences can result in a failed upgrade. Be sure to use the same version when
          upgrading from the Couchbase Server Community Edition to the Couchbase Server Enterprise
          Edition. <p>If you are performing an online upgrade, you can rebalance the nodes upgraded
            to Enterprise Edition into a Community Edition cluster.</p><p>If you are performing an
            offline upgrade from Community Edition to Enterprise Edition, shut down the entire
            cluster and uninstall Couchbase Server Community Edition from each machine. Then install
            Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition on these machines. The data files will be retained,
            and the cluster can be restarted.</p></dd>

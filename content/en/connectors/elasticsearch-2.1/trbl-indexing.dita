	<title>Troubleshooting indexing issues</title>
	<body>
		<p>If you encounter issues with indexing, such as failure to index items from Couchbase or
			unexpected items in your search results, try checking the following items and performing
			the described fixes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Change settings for initial indexing</p>
				<p>If you have an existing Couchbase data bucket with a large number of documents
					already in production, these documents will be transferred to Elasticsearch in bulk.
					Typically this works with Elasticsearch default settings, however there are some
					Elasticsearch settings you can change so that indexing quickly completes.</p>
				<p>You use the Elasticsearch <codeph>refresh_interval</codeph> setting to indicate how
					frequently the engine provides newly indexed items. During an initial bulk load of
					documents from Couchbase, you can reduce access to newly indexed items in exchange
					for overall faster indexing time. For more information about enabling and disabling
					this setting, see <xref
						href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-update-settings.html"
						format="html" scope="external">Update Indices Settings</xref> in the
						<cite>Elasticsearch Reference</cite>.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Check Elasticsearch mappings</p>
				<p>When you send documents to Elasticsearch it will automatically generate a mapping
					that contains rules for indexing fields. You can also provide your own mapping or
					update this mapping. Be aware that this default mapping from Elasticsearch includes
					assumptions about data types and data structures in your documents. Based on these
					assumptions, Elasticsearch may omit your document from the index. For instance,
					objects within an array may not be indexed as you expect.</p>
				<p>For general information about expected data structures see <xref
						href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html"
						format="html" scope="external">Mapping</xref> in the <cite>Elasticsearch
						Reference</cite>.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Check your documents</p>
				<p>Ensure your documents contain well-formed JSON. The Couchbase Plug-in for
					Elasticsearch will take any items that are binary data and will log an error message.
					Elasticsearch cannot index documents that are not valid JSON. JPEG files and other
					forms of binary data cannot be indexed by Elasticsearch.</p>
				<p>If you change a field type for your documents after Elasticsearch has indexed, it may
					omit your document from the index. </p>
			</li>
		</ul>

  <title>Setting Recovery Type</title>
  <shortdesc>Node recover type is set with the <codeph>POST /controller/setRecoverType</codeph> HTTP method and URI.</shortdesc>
  <refbody>
    
    <section><title>HTTP method and URI</title>
      <p>Sets the recovery type to be performed for a node. Recovery options are delta node recovery
        or full recovery. The recovery type for a node is set after the node is failed over and before rebalance. 
        Rebalance is required to apply the recovery.</p>

      <codeblock>POST /controller/setRecoveryType      </codeblock>
      <p>The progress of setting recovery type can be tracked just like rebalance. After the data is
        persisted to disk and replicas are up-to-date, the node is put into the failed over state. </p>

  <title>What's New in Version 4.5 Beta?</title>
  <body>
    <p>Couchbase Server 4.5 [Beta] builds on the advances of version 4 with faster, simpler, and
      more secure data processing. The new features include memory-optimized global indexes,
      indexing of embedded arrays, the ability to perform partial reads and writes to a JSON
      document without transferring the full document, an integrated Query Workbench in the Web
      Console, flexible JOINS with N1QL, and a new, fast and resilient enterprise backup and restore
      tool designed for big data and more. <note type="important"><p>This is a Beta version of
        Couchbase Server 4.5 and is intended for development purposes only. We consider Beta
        releases to have some rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA
        release. This release is <b>not supported</b> in production. </p><p>The Beta release does <b>not
            support</b> upgrading from an earlier version of Couchbase Server.</p></note></p>
    <section><title>Faster</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server version 4.5 enables performance, in some cases by an order of magnitude
        (10x), with enhancements to core data operations (get/set), secondary global indexes,
        enhancements to JOINs and additional query optimization rules. These, along with the
        features added in version 4.1 such as prepared execution of N1QL statements and covering
        indexes, give querying and indexing a significant boost. </p>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Fast Partial Reads and Writes to JSON Documents</dt>
          <dd>With Couchbase Server 4.5, applications no longer have to address the entire document. With the extended APIs, developers can operate on parts of a document without having to send the entire document back and forth between client and server. This can result in over 10 times faster performance with large documents. The result is enhanced performance and efficiency in the network IO path, especially when documents in the system are large. For more information, see <xref href="../developer-guide/sub-doc-api.dita"/>. </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Memory-Optimized Global Indexes</dt>
          <dd>Version 4 of Couchbase Server introduced <xref
              href="../architecture/global-secondary-indexes.dita"/> which are <xref
              href="../architecture/services-archi-multi-dimensional-scaling.dita">independently
              partitioned</xref> away from data for faster N1QL queries. Couchbase Server 4.5
            provides additional tuning for index processing and index scans. The new
            memory-optimized indexing provide over 20x improvement to query latencies and fresher
            index under heavy mutation rates (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). Unlike other databases,
            Couchbase Server global indexes are built to isolate the impact of indexing on
            performance of mutations, data ingest, and bulk data modifications using N1QL INSERT,
            UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE statements. Couchbase Server 4.5 memory-optimized indexes
            further enhances index processing and isolation of impact of indexing on the incoming
            workload. <p>You can enable the new memory-optimized global indexes through the index
              settings under the <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> tab in the Couchbase Server Web
              Console. For more information, see <xref href="../architecture/in-memory-indexes.dita"
              />.</p></dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Array Indexing</dt>
            <dd>N1QL provides a considerable number of verbs to process embedded structures and
            arrays such as <codeph>UNNEST</codeph> and <codeph>ANY</codeph>/<codeph>EVERY</codeph>
            operators. With the new array indexing feature, developers can optimize the execution of
            the queries. The new index can optimize queries that are looking for specific array
            elements and can result in multiple orders of magnitude improvement on query latency and
            throughput. Arrays are indexed using the new ARRAY keyword in <xref
              href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/createindex.dita">CREATE INDEX statement</xref>
            in N1QL. For more information, see <xref
              href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.dita"/>. </dd>
        </dlentry>
       <dlentry>
          <dt>Faster Read-Your-Own-Write (RYOW) Consistency with N1QL Queries</dt>
          <dd>Tunable consistency for N1QL and MapReduce queries helps improve the query performance. Using the previous versions, you could query data using eventual or strict consistency flag. With strictly consistent queries, the staleness parameter is set to false per query, which ensures that the query uses the request timestamp token to generate the results. With version 4.5, you can choose to grab the timestamp tokens from your last update, which ensures that you read your last update instead of the query request timestamp token. RYOW consistency provides the optimization required by applications that have to deal with high mutation rates but cannot compromise on consistency guarantees. See <xref href="../developer-guide/query-consistency.dita"></xref> for details.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Improved Index Write Performance with Circular Writes</dt>
          <dd>Global indexes use the new ForestDB engine for index storage. ForestDB uses an
            append-only architecture where full compaction is run as and when pages are orphaned
            with the appending writes. With version 4.5, ForestDB introduces circular compaction as
            an alternative to full compaction. Circular compaction reduces the disk size and IO
            bandwidth demands for indexes and reduces the requirement to run frequent full
            compaction operations. This improves the overall index maintenance and index read and
            write performance greatly for global indexes. Circular write is enabled by default. You
            can change the compaction settings from the <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Auto-Compaction</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> tab on the Web Console. See <xref
              href="../architecture/storage-architecture.dita#concept_x13_xlj_vs/circular-reuse"/>
            for more information. </dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Flexible Indexed JOINs in N1QL</dt>
          <dd>With version 4.5, N1QL introduces an extended <codeph>JOIN</codeph> syntax for added
            flexibility in JOINs. The new <codeph>JOIN ON KEY</codeph> … <codeph>FOR</codeph>
            keyword allows developers to specify JOIN operations that can use the left or the right
            keyspace for the JOIN. With the extended syntax, N1QL also makes better use of indexes
            to perform the JOIN operation faster across the two sides, and substantially lowers JOIN
            latencies. For example, <codeph>SELECT * FROM `beer-sample` brewery 
              JOIN `beer-sample` beer 
              ON KEY  beer.brewery_id  FOR brewery 
            WHERE  beer.type="beer" AND brewery.type="brewery" AND brewery.state="California";</codeph>.

    <section><title>Simpler</title>
      <p>Development and administration become simpler with Couchbase Server 4.5 with new integrated
        query development experience, smart schema inference on your data, enhanced query monitoring
        capabilities, a new robust and high performance enterprise backup and restore utility, an
        integrated full-text search service, and many more enhancements to N1QL and global secondary

          <dt>Integrated Query Workbench</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server 4.5 also provides a simple and visual way to develop and design
            queries with auto-complete for your N1QL statements. Query Workbench analyzes your
            bucket data to infer schemas of your document data and allows the execution of ad hoc
            queries directly from the Web Console. Query results are displayed in JSON, table, and
            tree formats, and can be saved. To use the new integrated Query Workbench, switch to the
            new <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> tab in the Couchbase Server Web Console. For more
            information, see <xref href="../tools/query-workbench.dita"/>.</dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Query Monitoring</dt>
          <dd>In Couchbase Server 4.5, N1QL adds several new keyspaces under the
              “<filepath>system:</filepath>” namespace to the existing list that provides
            information on indexes, buckets, and more. The new keyspaces under
              “<filepath>system:</filepath>" allow monitoring active requests, completed requests,
            system information and more. For a full list of new system keyspaces added to N1QL, see
              <xref href="../tools/query-monitoring.dita"/>. </dd>
        </dlentry>
<dlentry>
          <dt>Advanced Command-line Tooling for Query</dt>
          <dd>In previous releases, the <cmdname>cbq</cmdname> command line tool has been the
            central point for executing N1QL queries. Command line access to N1QL has been greatly
            improved in this release, and the new command line access provides smart connection
            management and full scriptability with version 4.5. For more information, see <xref href="../tools/cbq-shell.dita"></xref>.</dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Integrated Full Text Search (FTS) and new Search Service [Developer Preview]</dt>
          <dd>Full Text Search (FTS) enables you to create, manage, and query full text indexes on
            JSON documents stored in a Couchbase bucket. FTS provides a language-aware manner of
            searching with relevance ranking (scoring) for results. <note>The Full Text Search
              feature is still considered experimental and the UI or the functionality may change.

          <dt>Enterprise Backup and Restore</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server 4.5 provides a new enterprise backup and restore tool that can back
            up larger datasets with significantly higher performance than before. The scalable,
            high-performance backup and restore tool allows Couchbase Server to provide faster and
            more scalable recovery options to better integrate with Disaster Recovery planning. See

    <section><title>More Secure</title>
      
      <p>Security continues to be a strong priority for Couchbase Server development. Previous
        versions have added many <xref href="../security/security-intro.dita">security-related
          features</xref>, and version 4.5 continues to do so by adding support for X.509
        certificates and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for administrators. </p>    
      
<dl> 
  <dlentry>
          <dt>X509 Certificates</dt>
          <dd>With Couchbase Server 4.5, you can now integrate your signed certificate authority
            within Couchbase Server. X.509 certificates provide strongly trusted, on-the-wire
            encryption for client-server communication and across data centers. The new capability
            also makes it simple for administrators to manage and rotate certificates without
            application downtime. You can find detailed information about X.509 certificates <xref

          <dt>Role-Based Access Control for Administrators</dt>
          <dd>With version 4.5, Couchbase Server provides Role-Based Access Control for administrators. Aside from the existing encryption and auditing facilities, RBAC provides fine grain control over administrative access and simplifies compliance with governance rules. You can control administrative roles from the Settings tab in the Web Console. See <xref href="../security/concepts-rba.dita#concept_ntl_jph_hr"></xref> for details.</dd>

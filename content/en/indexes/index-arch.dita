	<title>Index service architecture</title>
	<shortdesc>The indexing service is designed to provide high-performance querying.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Indexing service contains the supervisor process that maintain the indexes. Index Service
			communicates with both the data service and query service. The following diagram shows the
			main components and communication channels.</p>
		<fig><image href="images/index-architecture.png" width="650px"></image></fig>
		<p>Supervisor: Supervisor communicates with the SQL for Documents (N1QL) query engine and
			responds to scan requests on the indexes. Supervisor also communicates with data service to
			maintain indexes as mutations arrive.</p>
		<p>Projector and Router: Indexing service embeds the projector and router process in each data
			service node. Projector and router listens on all mutations that happen on each bucket that
			has corresponding GSI indexes. For each mutation, it projects the subset of values relevant
			to the index. The relevant values in each mutation is sent to the corresponding supervisor
			process on the node that contains the index.</p> </conbody>

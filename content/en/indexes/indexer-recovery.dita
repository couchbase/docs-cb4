 <title>Index service recovery</title>
 <shortdesc>Index service recovery depends on the index coordinator and the client.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
   
   <p>Recovery occurs under the following conditions:</p>
   
   <ul>
  <li>The indexer coordinator verifies the meta data and the restart of shared DCP connections 
    (such as update and backfill). </li>
  <li>Each indexer handles its own recovery at its own speed.</li>
  <li>The client detects connection closures and restarts the connection 
    (for example, if there is a projector, router, or key-value failure).</li>
   </ul>

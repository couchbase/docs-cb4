 <title>DCP re-connection</title>
 <shortdesc>The process for reconnecting with DCP when there is an issue.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The process that the projector follows to reconnect to the DCP provider 
   due to a stream or connection termination or projector bootstrap.  
   This process occurs when there is no failover.</p>
  
  <p>High level synopsis of the process:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The projector tries to reconnect to the DCP provider based on the last sequence received. If
    it is successful, then the projector  resumes the connection.</li>   
   <li>The projector terminates the corresponding topics and subscribers associated with this DCP
    connection.</li>
    <li>The projector waits until a new connection request is recieved from the indexer
    coordinator.</li>
   <li>Once the project process restarts, the projector waits to receive new connection requests
    from the indexer coordinator.</li>
   <li>The topic re-subscribes to the projector after the connection is terminated. The connection
    between the subscriber and the indexer coordinator terminates when the projector process fails
    or the projector terminates the topic due to the DCP dis-connection.</li>
   <li>The indexer coordinator request a specific project for starting a new DCP connection.</li>
   </ol>

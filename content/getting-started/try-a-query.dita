		Run Your First N1QL Query
	</title>
	
	<shortdesc>
		N1QL (pronounced "nickel") is the Couchbase Server query language.

				About N1QL
			</title>
			
			<p>
				N1QL embraces the JSON document model and uses SQL-like syntax. In N1QL, you operate on JSON
				documents, and the result of your operation is another JSON document. N1QL queries can
				be run from the command line, using the <codeph>cbq</codeph>
				tool; or by means of the Query Workbench, provided by the Couchbase Web Console.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A basic N1QL query has the following parts:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<codeph>SELECT</codeph> &#8212; The fields of each document to return.</li>
				<li>
					<codeph>FROM</codeph> &#8212; The data bucket in which to look.</li>
				<li>
					<codeph>WHERE</codeph> &#8212; The conditions that the document must satisfy.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Here's an example of a basic N1QL query and the JSON document it returns. 
				The query asks for the country associated with the airline
				<i>Excel Airways</i> &#8212; note that for all identifiers (bucket names) that contain a hyphen character, you
				need to enclose the name with backtick (`) characters:
			</p>
			
			<codeblock outputclass="language-sql">SELECT country FROM `travel-sample` WHERE name = "Excel Airways";</codeblock>
			
			<p>
				The result is as follows:
			</p>
			
			<codeblock outputclass="language-json">{
    "requestID": "9e1cd084-f45e-4059-9e7a-edec30f60dd2",
    "signature": {
        "country": "json"
	},
    "results": [
        {
            "country": "United Kingdom"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
	"metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "7.42097249s",
        "executionTime": "7.420925841s",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 51
    }
}</codeblock>
			
			<p>
				The country is thus specified as <codeph>United Kingdom</codeph>.

				Making N1QL queries
			</title>
				<p>
					After you install Couchbase Server, you can start using N1QL right away; either with
					the interactive query shell, <codeph>cbq</codeph>; or with the Query Workbench, 
					which is provided by the Couchbase Web Console.
				</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section>
			
			<title>
				Try the Interactive Query Shell
			</title>
			
				<p id="run-cbq">
					To run the interactive query shell, <codeph>cbq</codeph>, bring up a console window 
					on your machine, and enter
					the following against the prompt:
				</p>
			
				<codeblock outputclass="bash">$ bash -c "clear &amp;&amp; docker exec -it db sh"</codeblock> 
				
				<p>
					Then, navigate to the Couchbase <codeph>bin</codeph> directory, and start <codeph>cbq</codeph>:
				</p>
			
				<codeblock outputclass="bash"># cd /opt/couchbase/bin
# ./cbq</codeblock>	
			
				<p>
					This displays the <codeph>cbq</codeph> shell prompt, against which you can enter N1QL
					commands against your currently installed buckets. For example, the following query returns
					the different values used by documents in the <codeph>travel-sample</codeph> bucket 
					for the <codeph>callsign</codeph>
					field, limiting the number of results to 5:
				</p>
						
				<codeblock outputclass="language-sql">cbq> SELECT callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5;</codeblock>
			
				<p>
					The result is as follows:
				</p>
				
				<codeblock outputclass="language-sql">{
    "requestID": "ae6fcd5b-e7f0-4725-ae1d-a38678c13a3e",
    "signature": {
        "callsign": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "TXW"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "atifly"
        },
        {
             "callsign": null
        },
        {
             "callsign": "LOCAIR"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "33.748019ms",
        "executionTime": "33.673901ms",
        "resultCount": 5,
        "resultSize": 215
    }
}</codeblock>
			
			<p>
				The result thus contains five callsign-values. A callsign is associated with an airline; and
				<codeph>airline</codeph> is one of the document-types that the <codeph>travel-sample</codeph> bucket
				contains. Others are <codeph>airport</codeph> and <codeph>hotel</codeph>. You can search on a type: for example,
				the following query returns a maximum of one
				<codeph>airport</codeph> document, and lists all the fields it
				contains :
				</p>
						
				<codeblock outputclass="language-sql">cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="airport" LIMIT 1;</codeblock>
				
				<p>
					The query-result is as follows:
				</p>
				
				<codeblock outputclass="language-sql">{

				Try the Query Workbench
			</title>
		
			<p>
				The Couchbase Web Console
				provides a <i>Query Workbench</i>, at which you can compose and execute N1QL queries.
				Left-click on the <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> tab, located on the horizontal control-bar, near
				the top of the Couchbase Web Console:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<image href="./images/queryButton.png" id="query_button" align="left" width="100"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This brings up the Query Workbench. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<image href="./images/queryWorkbench.png" id="query_workbench" align="left" width="720"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The workbench has three principal areas, which are:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					An upper panel, which features the prompt <codeph>Enter a query here</codeph>: and this is indeed
					where you will type your N1QL query. 
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li>
					A <uicontrol>Bucket Analysis</uicontrol> panel, at the lower-left. This provides information on the
					buckets currently maintained by your system. Right now, it shows that just one exists; the
					bucket <codeph>travel-sample</codeph>. 
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li>
					A <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel, at the lower-right. This shows query-results; and provides
					a number of options for their display. To start with, you will use the default option, which is
					selectable by the <uicontrol>JSON</uicontrol> button, and duly displays results in JSON-format.
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
					
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				You can now use the Query Workbench to enter a N1QL query. In the upper panel, enter the following:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<image href="./images/firstQuery.png" id="first_query" align="left" width="660"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To execute your query, left-click on the <uicontrol>Execute</uicontrol> button, at the upper-left:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<image href="./images/executeButton.png" id="execute_button" align="left" width="100"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Query-results now appear in the <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<image href="./images/queryResultsJSON.png" id="query_results_json" align="left" width="660"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As you can see, a single document was found to match your specified criterion: which was the document
				whose <codeph>name</codeph> value is <codeph>40-Mile Air</codeph> (which is, in fact, the document you took an initial
				look at, during the previous stage of the <i>Getting Started</i> sequence).

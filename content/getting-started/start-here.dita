		If you are a first-time user, you can get a great, quick introduction to using Couchbase Server, just by reading
		this section. In a few brief steps, you obtain direct experience of installing, running, and performing
		interactive queries on the server. You also get access to a simple code example; which is runnable out-of-the-box,
		and provides immediate insight into how the Couchbase SDK can be used to enrich and extend your applications.

				You'll now be guided through some of the key aspects of Couchbase Server. At the conclusion of the sequence,
				you'll have attained an excellent starting-point for further, more detail-driven activities. The
				steps are as follows:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				
				<li>
					Do a Quick Install	
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Look at the Results	

					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Try a Query	
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Run Hello World!	
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Choose Your Next Steps	
					
					<p>
						<!-- Vertical space -->
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

				If, at any stage, you decide that you wish to
				depart from the sequence, and make an immediate deep-dive into a specific topic, you can do so: by means
				of links to <i>Other Destinations</i>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Alternatively, if you do elect to
				work continuously through the whole sequence (as indeed we suggest), you ultimately arrive at the 
				<xref href="./choose-your-next-steps.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Choose Your Next Steps</xref>
				section; which provides a comprehensive list of options for gaining further
				knowledge of Couchbase server.

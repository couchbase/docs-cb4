      <p><b>Flexible way to Extract Identity from Client Certificates</b></p>
      <p>While release 4.5 added the ability to use client certificates, it required the identity to
        be encoded in a particular way. However, the identity in client certificates can be encoded
        in different ways for different kinds of users. This release (version 5.1) adds a flexible
        scheme to extract the identity from client certificates.</p>

      <p>The <cmdname>cbbackupmgr</cmdname> utility stores and restores the bucket configuration
        along with the backed-up data. If your bucket configuration settings have been updated since
        your last backup, then restoring a previous backup will overwrite these settings by default.
        Now you can choose to not restore the bucket configuration by setting the
          "<codeph>--disable-bucket-config</codeph>" flag.</p>

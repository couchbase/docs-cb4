      <p><b>Couchbase Analytics [Beta]</b></p>
      <p>Couchbase Analytics is now in Beta! Our Analytics service enables you to analyze your JSON data in real time without the need to extract, transform, load (ETL) your data into a separate system. It allows you to develop
        insight-driven applications quickly and easily using the same SDKs. It removes the need for
        ETL and the complexity of managing a separate analytics system. With this release, Analytics
        is fully integrated with Couchbase Server and no longer requires a separate installation.
        Couchbaseâ€™s unique architecture for Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) allows operational and
        analytical queries to run concurrently without impacting one another, providing the workload
        isolation required for production deployments. To learn more about this service, see <xref
          href="../analytics/introduction.html" format="html">Couchbase Analytics</xref>.</p>
      
      <p><b>Support for Timers in Couchbase Functions</b></p>
      <p>This release adds support for timers in Couchbase Functions. Timers enable asynchronous
        compute in reference to wall-clock events. They are constructs which developers can use to
        specify a routine (business logic) to be triggered at a future time. For more information,
        see <xref
          href="../eventing/eventing-language-constructs.dita#eventing_language_constructs/timers"

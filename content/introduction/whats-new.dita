    <p>Couchbase Server 5.5 (Developer Build) is a significant update of the Couchbase Data
      Platform. This release specifically highlights agility, performance, and manageability and
      includes enhancements to existing services as well as new server and SDK components that have
      been in the works for a long time. Take a look at the <xref
        href="../release-notes/relnotes.dita#topic_gbk_tyh_t5">release notes</xref> for a list of
      known and fixed issues in this release.</p>
    <note type="important"><p>This pre-release version of Couchbase Server 5.5 (Developer Build) is intended for development
        purposes only. Some features are still in development and may have some rough edges and
        bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release. This pre-release version is
          <b>not supported</b> in production. </p><p>The pre-release versions do <b>not support</b> upgrading from an earlier version of Couchbase
        Server.</p></note>
    
    <section> <title>Unmatched Agility and Flexibility</title>
      <p><b>ANSI joins in N1QL</b></p>
      <p>The Couchbase Data Platform is the only platform that extends SQL to support JSON data
        natively via N1QL queries. N1QL now has support for ANSI joins making it easier to migrate
        applications from RDBMS to Couchbase. Developers are also more productive as they can
        leverage their SQL knowledge to develop applications on Couchbase. ANSI joins support
        improves data modeling capability and flexibility with Couchbase. Since you can join based
        on arbitrarily complex expressions, business requirements can be coded and translated
        effectively and efficiently. We've extended ANSI syntax to join on both scalars and arrays.
        See the <xref
          href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/from.dita#topic_rnt_zfk_np/section_ek1_jnx_1db"/>
        for details.</p>
      <p><b>Couchbase Eventing Service</b></p>
      <p>This release introduces our Couchbase Eventing Service – a multidimensional-scaling(MDS)
        enabled service that lets you process changes to data as they happen in real-time. Couchbase
        Functions is the first offering under the Couchbase Eventing Service that enables you to
        write server-side functions that are automatically triggered using the familiar
        Event-Condition-Action model. It is extremely easy to use via an online JavaScript code
        editor that lets you develop and debug the code on generated mutations to the data residing
        in Couchbase cluster. The Couchbase Eventing Service handles all the complexity of scaling
        to a large number of document mutations. This new offering enables you to develop deeply
        engaging and personalized user experiences based on real-time events. To learn more about
        this new service, see <xref href="../eventing/eventing-overview.dita#topic_kp4_qth_t5"
        />.</p>
      <p><b>Couchbase Analytics (Developer Preview)</b></p>
      <p>Couchbase Analytics (currently in Developer Preview) enables you to analyze your
        JSON data in real time without the need to extract, transform, load (ETL) your data into a
        separate system. It allows you to develop insight-driven applications quickly and easily
        using the same SDKs. It removes the need for ETL and the complexity of managing a separate
        analytics system. Couchbase’s unique architecture for Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) allows
        operational and analytical queries to run concurrently without impacting one another,
        providing the workload isolation required for production deployments. To learn more about
        this service, see <xref href="../analytics/introduction.html" format="html">Couchbase Analytics</xref>.</p>

    <section> <title>Unparalleled Performance at Scale</title>
      <p><b>Aggregate optimization</b></p>
      <p>One of the key advantages of a declarative query language like N1QL is that the system can
        optimize and improve the query plans and execution without changing the applications. Since
        the introduction of N1QL, Couchbase has improved the query performance by orders of
        magnitude, and with aggregate optimization, the query engine leverages the indexes to
        perform aggregate calculations to improve the performance of queries by another order of
        magnitude. Your existing aggregate queries with matching indexes will simply run faster. See
          <xref
          href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/groupby-aggregate-performance.dita#groupby-aggregate-performance"
        /> for details.</p>
      <p><b>Index partitioning</b></p>
      <p>With support for index partitioning, you can now index a large number of documents and horizontally scale out an index as needed. The system will partition the index across a number of index nodes using hash partitioning. Index partitioning is transparent to queries – one does not have to update the queries when changing the index partitioning strategy.</p>
      <p><b>Data compression</b></p>
      <p>With end-to-end compression from client to storage, Couchbase significantly reduces the
        cost of network, memory, and storage required for your existing workloads. Documents are
        transparently compressed when transferred between the clients and the servers, in the server
        cache, and on disk. Documents are also compressed when transferred between clusters across
        data centers. See <xref href="../architecture/core-data-access-compression.dita#compression"
        /> for more information.</p>

    <section> <title>Ease of Platform Management</title>
      <p><b>Deploying and managing Couchbase at scale with Kubernetes</b></p>
      <p>An open source system for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications,
        Kubernetes handles the work of scheduling containers onto a cluster and manages the
        workloads to ensure they run as the user intended. By leveraging the latest features from
        Kubernetes to support stateful applications, we allow users to leverage their investment in
        Kubernetes and containers to easily deploy and manage Couchbase clusters at scale. In
        addition, a close partnership with Red Hat is bringing all of this capability to OpenShift.
        See the <xref
          href="http://docs.couchbase.com/prerelease/couchbase-operator/beta/overview.html"
          format="html" scope="external">Couchbase Operator User's Guide</xref> for more
        information.</p>
      <p><b>Auto failover</b></p>
      <p>Couchbase further improves high availability for mission-critical deployments without operator intervention. Couchbase enhances the detection of common disk failures and automatically fails over the node with bad disks without operator intervention. It also handles multiple server failures based on the replica count to avoid data loss, and can fail over an entire server group if a rack or zone is not available.</p>
      <p><b>Security compliance</b></p>
      <p>Couchbase continues to extend its support for security to enable enterprises to meet
        increasing security compliance requirements such as the EU's General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR) effective May 2018. We extend <xref
          href="../security/security-certs-auth.dita#topic_pcr_mvh_p1b">X.509 certificate
          authentication</xref> beyond key-value data access to query and search services for <xref
          href="../sdk/dotnet/sdk-authentication-overview.dita#sdk_authentication">all SDK</xref>.
        We also support field-level encryption in our SDKs to protect sensitive user data. Users can
          <xref href="../settings/cluster-settings.dita#topic_h12_hqn_vs">enable log
          redaction</xref> to prevent leaking sensitive user data when using the logs for
        troubleshooting production issues. Furthermore, we employ system auditing to track all admin
        and non-admin access, including <xref href="../security/n1ql-auditing.dita#n1ql-auditing"
          >auditing of query statements</xref>.</p>
      <p><b>End-to-end traceability</b></p>
      <p>With end-to-end traceability, you now have telemetry for monitoring how well your Couchbase
        cluster is meeting your application SLAs. You can correlate timing information from client
        through to server and back to quickly triage performance issues and help identify the root
        cause of performance issues. The performance of operations are all exposed via methods you
        are already familiar with in the Couchbase SDK. See <xref
          href="../sdk/dotnet/threshold-logging.dita#threshold-logging"/> for details.</p>
      <p><b>IPv6 support</b></p>
      <p>With the explosion of mobile and IoT devices, enterprises are seeing an increasing
        percentage of their user traffic coming from IPv6. Many large enterprises are starting to
        deploy IPv6 infrastructure to support these IPv6 devices. We have added IPv6 support to
        enable our customers to deliver exceptional user experiences with the Couchbase Data
        Platform. See <xref href="../install/ipv6-setup.dita#ipv6-setup"/> for more information.</p>
    </section>
    <section> <title>Other Major Enhancements</title>
      <p><b>Query: ALTER INDEX</b></p>
      <p>This new declarative command provides administrators the ability to move indexes from one
        node to the other. See <xref
          href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/alterindex.dita#untitled1"/> for details.</p>
      <p><b>Index: Index usage parameters on the Web Console</b></p>
      <p>Revamped Administrator Console and REST endpoints that expose various index usage parameters.</p>
      <p><b>Search: Geospatial searches</b></p>
      <p>Point/distance and bounding box queries on point data are now GA. See <xref
          href="../fts/fts-geospatial-queries.dita#geospatial_queries"/> for details.</p>
      <p><b>Tools: Enhancements to cbbackupmgr utility</b></p>
      <p>For more information, see <xref href="../backup-restore/cbbackupmgr.dita#cbbackupmgr.1"
        />.</p>
      <p><b>Docs editor</b></p>
      <p>Edit document data from the user interface without the syntactic constraints of JSON.</p>
      <p><b>SDK enhancements</b></p>
      <p>Many improvements are exposed through the Couchbase SDK, therefore update to the latest
        versions to ensure maximum compatibility. See the <xref
          href="../sdk/java/start-using-sdk.dita#topic_vpj_dh5_xv">SDK documentation</xref> for

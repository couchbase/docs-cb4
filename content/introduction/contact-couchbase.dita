          Submit Documentation Changes
        </title>
        
        <p>
          If you find a documentation-error, you can left click on the link at the upper right of each page:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/editOnGitHub.png" id="edit_on_git_hub" align="left" width="120"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This provides an interactive edit-pane, in which the page-source can be directly edited:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/gitHubEditPane.png" id="git_hub_edit_pane" align="left" width="580"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When you have made your edits, left-click on the <uicontrol>Commit changes</uicontrol> button,
          at the lower left:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/commitChangesButton.png" id="commit_changes_button" align="left" width="200"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This allow you to open a <i>pull request</i>, which will be reviewed by Couchbase staff-members prior
          to integration into the documentation set.
        </p>

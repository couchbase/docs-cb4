        Submit a Ticket

        <p>
          If you have a JIRA account, you can submit tickets to Couchbase. When submitting, include all
          information that might be appropriate. For example:
        </p>
      
        <ul>
         
          <li>
            <p>
              A description of your environment (package installation, build number, operating system, etc).
            </p>

          </li>
            

          <li>
          <p> All steps required to reproduce the issue. This should include all relevant
            expression-names, parameters, flags, and values; with sample output in verbose mode from
            repeated executions, using different values.  </p>
        </li>
          
          <li>
            <p>
              Logs from all cluster-nodes.
            </p>
          </li>
            
            
          <li>
            <p>
              Query-results from the command-line, when failures have occurred through use of the UI; and <i>vice versa</i>.
            </p>
          </li>
         
        </ul>

      <section id="submit_documentation_changes">
        
        <title>
          Submit Documentation Changes
        </title>
        
        <p>
          If you find a documentation-error, to fix it, you can left-click on the link at the upper right of each page:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/editOnGitHub.png" id="edit_on_git_hub" align="left" width="120"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This takes you to an interactive edit-pane, in which the page-source can be directly edited:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/gitHubEditPane.png" id="git_hub_edit_pane" align="left" width="640"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When you have made your edits, left-click on the <uicontrol>Commit changes</uicontrol> button,
          at the lower left:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="./images/commitChangesButton.png" id="commit_changes_button" align="left" width="200"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This allows you to open a <i>pull request</i>, which will be reviewed by Couchbase staff-members, prior
          to integration of your submitted changes into the documentation-set.
        </p>

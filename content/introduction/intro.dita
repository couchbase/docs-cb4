	<title>Introduction</title>
	<shortdesc>Couchbase Server is an open source, document-oriented, distributed database that
		provides low-latency data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT
		applications.</shortdesc>

	<conbody>
		<p>Couchbase Server exposes the underlying key-value store and managed cache. The embedded
			version, Couchbase Lite, runs native on-device in mobile and IoT environments and manages
			sync to Couchbase Server. </p>

			<title>Flexible data model, dynamic schemas</title>

			<p>Modern applications are built and managed by smaller, closely knit teams of developers and
				administrators who do more with less. Organizations practice agile development and
				continuous integration: applications are built, released, and modified at much shorter
				intervals–weeks or days. Couchbase Server's flexible data model and dynamic schemas
				enable frequent changes to the data model–such as new data types–without slowing down
				development or compromising application performance.</p>
			<p>Couchbase differs from typical databases by supporting a flexible data model rather than
				rigidly enforcing fixed schemas. Couchbase documents are JSON, a self-describing format
				capable of representing rich structures and relationships. Unlike a traditional RDBMS,
				the schema in Couchbase Server is a logical construct entirely defined in the
				application code and captured in the structure of the stored documents. Since there is
				no explicit schema to maintain, developers can add new objects and properties at any
				time just by storing new JSON. Because of this, schemas are dynamic and change when the
				application changes. This makes it straightforward and intuitive to evolve an
				application, since there’s only one place to modify. You can evolve your application
				gradually or suddenly, as you see fit and without having to perform painful schema
				migrations. Couchbase Server's flexible data model and dynamic schemas enable frequent
				changes to the data model–such as new data types–without slowing down development or
				compromising application performance. </p>

			<title>Powerful query language</title>

			<p>Couchbase Server can be queried by using N1QL, an expressive, powerful, and complete SQL
				dialect for querying, transforming, and manipulating JSON data. As SQL, it’s immediately
				familiar to developers, who can quickly get started developing rich applications. To
				help users develop rich applications with agility, N1QL is supported by a rich index
				infrastructure and also has extensions that allow it to handle heterogeneous documents
				with nested structures. N1QL is accessible to a full range of tools for analytics and
				data integration via JDBC and ODBC, such as Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and
				Informatica.</p>

			<title>Submillisecond latencies at scale</title>

			<p>Couchbase Server is designed to process online operational data-heavy read and write
				traffic for large modern web, mobile, and IoT applications: highly scalable applications
				that are built to extremely high standards of responsiveness in the user interface. For
				Couchbase Server, low latency at scale typically refers to consistent sub-millisecond
				reads and writes. While maximum raw speeds are important, many practitioners care more
				about being able to deliver those high speeds and low latencies with minimal variance
				during heavy workloads. Couchbase continues to deliver consistently high performance
				even under heavy load. Predictable, consistent performance guarantees responsiveness and
				improves the user experience in real-world deployments. </p>
			<p>Couchbase Server is a memory-centric system that intelligently keeps frequently accessed
				documents, metadata, and indexes in RAM, yielding high read/write throughput at very low
				latency. &#x2028;These capabilities arise from Couchbase’s integral object managed
				cache, which is a distributed hash table with full memcached API compatibility. The
				document database makes heavy use of the object managed cache. </p>
			<p>Couchbase Server is a true operational store that serves end customer requests directly.
				This contrasts with Hadoop and Spark, which are primarily analytic and machine learning
				environments that are accessed by analysts and data scientists and which tolerate orders
				of magnitude more latency.</p>

			<title>Easy, elastic scaling</title>

			<p>Replication and sharding are fundamental features of Couchbase Server. It automatically
				distributes data across nodes in the cluster. Thus, the database can grow horizontally
				to share load by adding more RAM, disk, and CPU capacity, without increasing the burden
				on developers and administrators. Couchbase Server achieves high hardware efficiency by
				employing asynchronous, non-blocking I/O at all levels for effective utilization of
				server resources. This maximizes both the storage I/O and the number of simultaneously
				connected clients per node. Couchbase’s architecture ensures that workloads are evenly
				distributed across cluster nodes, reducing bottlenecks and allowing users to take full
				advantage of the available hardware. </p>

			<title>Ease of administration</title>
			<p>Couchbase Server is extremely simple to deploy and manage. Features such as replication are
				built in and happen automatically. Topology changes happen transparently, without
				needing changes to the application or other Couchbase nodes. Each Couchbase Server node
				consists of completely identical software, making automation a breeze. The entire
				cluster is managed through a single administrator console that offers single-click
				cluster expansion and rebalance. Even highly sophisticated technology, such as cross
				data center replication, can be configured with a single click in the admin console.</p>

			<title>High availability</title>


			<p>Built with a strong emphasis on reliability, high availability, and simple management,
				an important feature of Couchbase Server is that all operations can be done while the
				system remains online, without requiring modifications or interrupting running
				applications. The system never needs to be taken offline for routine maintenance such as
				software upgrades, index building, compaction, hardware refreshes, or any other
				operation. Even provisioning or removing nodes can be done entirely online without any
				interruption to running applications, and without requiring developers to modify their
				applications. </p>
			
			<p>Equally important, Couchbase Server’s built-in fault tolerance mechanisms protect
				against downtime caused by arbitrary unplanned incidents, including server failures.
				Replication and failover are important mechanisms that increase system availability.
				Couchbase Server replicates data across multiple nodes to support failover. Ensuring
				that additional copies of the data are available in case of the inevitable failures that
				large distributed systems are designed to recover from. All of this is done
				automatically without need for manual intervention or downtime.</p>
			
			<p>Entire Couchbase Server clusters can be replicated to one or more alternate geographical
				locations using cross data center replication (XDCR), a technology that delivers increased
				high availability, disaster recovery and geographic load balancing. XDCR addresses the
				unique challenges inherent in linking clusters that span across a wide-area network
				(WAN) rather than simply extending local-cluster replication across a WAN.</p>

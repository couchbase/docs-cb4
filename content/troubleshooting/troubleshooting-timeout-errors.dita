  <shortdesc>Timeout errors when querying a view with <codeph>stale=false.</codeph></shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>When querying a view with <codeph>stale=false</codeph>, you get often timeout errors for one
      or more nodes. These nodes are nodes that did not receive the original query request.</p>
    <p>For example, you query node 1 and get timeout errors for nodes 2, 3 and 4 as in the example
      below (view with reduce function _count):</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>&gt; curl -s 'http://localhost:9500/default/_design/dev_test2/_view/view2?full_set=true&amp;stale=false'
{"rows":[
  {"key":null,"value":125184}
],
"errors":[
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9503/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"},
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9501/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"},
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9502/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"}
]
}
</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>The problem here is that, by default, for full consistency queries with
        <codeph>stale=false</codeph> the view merging node, or the node which receive the query
      request (node 1 in this example). waits up to 60000 milliseconds (1 minute) to receive partial
      view results from each other node in the cluster. If it waits for more than 1 minute for
      results from a remote node, it stops waiting for results from that node and a timeout error
      entry is added to the final response. A <codeph>stale=false</codeph> request blocks a client,
      or the view merger node as in this example, until the index is up to date, so these timeouts
      can happen frequently.</p>
    <p>If you look at the logs from those nodes you got a timeout error, you’ll see the index
      build/update took more than 60 seconds, example from node 2:</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>[couchdb:info,2012-08-20T15:21:13.150,n_1@192.168.1.80:&lt;0.6234.0&gt;:couch_log:info:39] Set view

</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>In this case, node 2 took 103.774 seconds to update the index.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid those timeouts, you can pass a large connection_timeout in the view query
      URL, example:</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>&gt; time curl -s
 'http://localhost:9500/default/_design/dev_test2/_view/view2?full_set=true&amp;stale=false&amp;connection_timeout=999999999'
{"rows":[
{"key":null,"value":2000000}
]
}
real  2m44.867s
user   0m0.007s
sys    0m0.007s
</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>And in the logs of nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively you’ll see something like this:</p>
    <p><codeph>node 1, view merger node</codeph></p>

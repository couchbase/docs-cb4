   <title>Blocked indexer</title>
   <shortdesc>Indexer shows no progress for long periods of time.</shortdesc>
   <body>
      <p>Each design document maps to one indexer, so when the indexer runs it updates all views
         defined in the corresponding design document. Indexing takes resources (CPU, disk IO,
         memory); therefore Couchbase Server limits the maximum number of indexers that can run in
         parallel. There are 2 configuration parameters to specify the limit, one for regular
         (main/active) indexers and other for replica indexers (more on this in a later section).
         The default for the former is 4 and for the later is 2. To query:</p>
      <codeblock><codeph>&gt; curl -s 'http://Administrator:asdasd@localhost:8091/settings/maxParallelIndexers'
{"globalValue":4,"nodes":{"n_0@192.168.1.80":4}}
</codeph></codeblock>
      <p><codeph>maxParallelIndexers</codeph> is for main indexes, and
            <codeph>maxParallelReplicaIndexers</codeph> is for replica indexes. When there are more
         design documents (indexers) than maxParallelIndexers, some indexers are blocked until
         there’s a free slot, and the rule is simple as first-come-first-served. These slots are
         controlled by 2 barriers processes, one for main indexes, and the other for replica
         indexes. Their current state can be seen from <codeph>_active_tasks</codeph> (per node),
         for example, when there’s no indexing happening:</p>
      <codeblock><codeph>&gt; curl -s 'http://localhost:9500/_active_tasks' | json_xs
[
 {
     "waiting" : 0,
         "started_on" : 1345642656,
         "pid" : "&lt;0.234.0&gt;",
         "type" : "couch_main_index_barrier",
         "running" : 0,
         "limit" : 4,
         "updated_on" : 1345642656
         },
 {
     "waiting" : 0,
         "started_on" : 1345642656,
         "pid" : "&lt;0.235.0&gt;",
         "type" : "couch_replica_index_barrier",
         "running" : 0,
         "limit" : 2,
         "updated_on" : 1345642656
         }
 ]

      <p>The <codeph>waiting</codeph> fields tells us how many indexers are blocked or waiting for
         their turn to run. Queries with <codeph>stale=false</codeph> have to wait for the indexer
         to be started (if not already), unblocked and to finish, which can lead to a long time when
         there are many design documents in the system. </p>
      <p>The indexer for a particular design document might be running for one node, but it might be
         blocked in another node. When the indexer is blocked on one node, it’s not necessarily
         blocked on all nodes and vice versa: when it is running, it is not necessarily running in
         all nodes of the cluster. Verify the status by querying <codeph>_active_tasks</codeph> for
         each node.  This API is not meant for direct user consumption but only for developers and
         for debugging and troubleshooting.</p>
      <p>Through <codeph>_active_tasks</codeph> (remember, it’s per node, so check it for every node
         in the cluster), you can see which indexers are running and which are blocked. Following is
         an example with 5 design documents (indexers) and <codeph>&gt;maxParallelIndexers</codeph>
         is 4:</p>

      <p>The indexer for design document _design/test is represented by a task with a
            <codeph>type</codeph> field of <codeph>blocked_indexer</codeph>, while other indexers
         have a task with type <codeph>indexer</codeph>, meaning they’re running. The task with type
            <codeph>couch_main_index_barrier</codeph> confirms this by telling us there are
         currently 4 indexers running and 1 waiting for its turn. When an indexer is allowed to
         execute, its active task with type <codeph>blocked_indexer</codeph> is replaced by a new
         one with type <codeph>indexer</codeph>.</p>

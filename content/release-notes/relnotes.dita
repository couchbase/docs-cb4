    <p>Couchbase Server 4.6 delivers some exciting capabilities for cross datacenter replication,
      security, query, tools, and application development. Take a look at <xref
        href="../introduction/whats-new.dita">What's new</xref> for a list of new features and
      improvements that are available in this release.</p>
    <section id="release-4.6.5"><title>Release 4.6.5</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server 4.6.5 was released in June 2018. This is the fifth maintenance release in
        the 4.6.x series of Couchbase Server and includes important bug fixes applicable to all
        prior 4.x releases. We recommend that you upgrade to the 4.6.5 release and deploy these
        important bug fixes.</p>
      <p id="upgrade-to-465"><b>Upgrading to Version 4.6.5</b></p>
      <p>Since most Couchbase Server upgrade procedures involve rebalance, some care must be taken
        when upgrading from a version prior to 4.6.5 to avoid being affected by <xref
          href="https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29959" format="html" scope="external"
          >MB-29959</xref>. Specifically, graceful failover and/or remove+rebalance should not be
        used to start this upgrade. As such, there are a few best practice approaches: <ol
          id="ol_vzl_trx_h2b">
          <li>Add a net-new node of at least 4.6.5 to any existing cluster first. This new node will
            become the orchestrator and any further rebalance will not be affected. From then on,
            follow the instructions in <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade">Performing
              Online Upgrade</xref>. </li>
          <li>If a net-new node is not available, a hard failover can be performed on any node, that
            node upgraded to 4.6.5 and then re-added to the cluster. This is only required for the
            first node and, as per #1 above, any further rebalance operations will not be affected.
            From then on, follow the instructions in <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade">Performing
              Online Upgrade</xref>.</li>
          <li>As XDCR is not affected by MB-29959, upgrading one cluster in a multi-cluster setup is
            also supported. Ensure that no writes are going to the cluster during its upgrade unless
            following the approaches listed in #1 or #2 above. For instructions, see <xref
              href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/intercluster">Upgrade Using Inter-cluster Replication</xref>.</li>
          <li>Offline upgrade will not be affected. For instructions, see <xref
            href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/offline">Performing the Offline Upgrade</xref>.</li>

              <entry>During rebalance, it was observed that sometimes in-flight mutations did not

              <entry>If a Data Service Couchbase Server node is added to a cluster using the same
                IP/host name of a node that has been a member of a cluster previously without first
                failing-over the old node, data loss can occur as the new node does not have the
                expected data. This has been fixed by first checking to see if the node is a part of
                the cluster before adding it.</entry>

              <entry>When the Query Workbench failed to get the list of buckets, it resulted in a
                failure of all subsequent queries until the browser was refreshed and a valid list

                the bucket analysis tab. Additionally, when the query engine starts working again,
                queries on non-password-protected buckets will work. However, if you want to query
                password-protected buckets, you need to either click the refresh button on the
                bucket analysis tab, or switch tabs away-from, and then back-to the query tab. </entry>

              <entry>When the host name in a remote cluster reference is unusable, XDCR picks an
                alternative target node in a more deterministic manner so that all source nodes
                would pick the same alternative target node.</entry>

              <entry>XDCR incorrectly deletes replication streams. The replication periodically
                checks the source bucket status and if it detects a change in the source bucket
                UUID, which is caused by either bucket deletion or recreation, it deletes itself.
                However, replication incorrectly deleted itself when the source bucket check failed
                with an error that was not a change in the UUID. This has been fixed.</entry>

              <entry>Computing sequence numbers in XDCR had an inefficiency when there were large
                gaps between sequence numbers and took much longer than needed to complete. This
                caused various issues such as stats missing from the log file and replication

    <section id="release-4.6.0"><title>Release 4.6.0</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server 4.6.0 was released in February 2017.</p>
      <p><b>Supported Platforms</b></p>
      <p>This release also adds support for Microsoft Windows 10 Anniversary Edition and Mac OS
        Sierra. For more information, see <xref href="../install/install-platforms.dita#topic1634"
        />.</p>
      <p><b>Changes in Behavior</b></p>
      <p>Here are the behavior changes in the product, compared to the previous release: <ul
          id="ul_zs4_whs_dz">
          <li>Results for the <codeph>OBJECT_PAIRS</codeph> and <codeph>OBJECT_INNER_PAIRS</codeph>
              functions:<p dir="ltr">Starting from version 4.6.0, the results generated by
                <codeph>OBJECT_PAIRS</codeph> and <codeph>OBJECT_INNER_PAIRS</codeph> functions use
              the word "val" for value instead of the N1QL reserved word "value". </p><p dir="ltr"
              >For example:
            </p><codeblock>"results": [ 
      { "$1": [ { "name": "key1", "<b>val</b>": "val1" } ] 
       }
  ] </codeblock></li>
          <li>CREATE INDEX is not allowed using any of the document metadata attributes except
              <codeph>meta().id</codeph>: <p>In earlier releases, CREATE INDEX on metadata such as
                <codeph>meta().cas</codeph>, <codeph>meta().flags</codeph>,
                <codeph>meta().expiry</codeph> etc. were allowed, but respective metadata attributes
              weren’t getting indexed. Couchbase Server 4.6 allows only <codeph>meta().id</codeph>
              attribute in index-key expressions when creating secondary index.</p></li>
          <li>META function:<p><codeph>META()</codeph> with no keyspace parameter can be used in
              N1QL statements when that query/statement refers to only one keyspace or bucket. When
              multiple keyspaces are referred in a query (for example, JOIN or NEST), then the META
              expressions must be used with specific keyspace names as parameter, such as
                <codeph>META(keyspace)</codeph>. In earlier releases, this requirement is not
              enforced, and <codeph>META()</codeph> with no parameters is still accepted, implicitly
              referring to the first keyspace name used in the query. Couchbase 4.6 enforces this
              requirement and throws syntax error if <codeph>META()</codeph> is used with no
              parameter.</p></li>
          <li>Upgrading Couchbase Server when Full Text Search (FTS) Service is enabled: <p>When
              upgrading a cluster with nodes running FTS, upgrades will fail unless all full text
              index definitions are first deleted. To upgrade a cluster with FTS indexes, first save
              the existing index definition JSON, then remove all full text indexes. Then upgrade
              all nodes to the desired version. Once all nodes are upgraded, recreate the index
              definitions using the REST API. Note that you need to manually remove the
                <codeph>byte_array_converter</codeph> attribute from the index definition JSON (see

                <entry>When using XDCR from a cluster running Couchbase Server 4.x (prior to 4.6.0)
                  to a 4.6.0 cluster, XDCR stops when it tries to replicate
                    <codeph>tombstones</codeph> (deletes) and fails with an error message EINVAL.<p>

                  <p>The <codeph>cbbackupmgr merge</codeph> command will not function correctly and
                    may cause data corruption under the following circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The bucket being backed up is <xref

                    <li> The bucket being backed up is deleted and re-created in between incremental
                      backups </li>

                  <p><b>Workaround</b>: In the interim, the recommendation is to perform a full
                    backup if you experience any of the above scenarios. This will lead to longer
                    backup times than performing incremental backups, but will avoid potential data
                    corruption due to to the aforementioned issue.</p>

              <entry><p><b>Summary</b>: It is possible for a rebalance of the Analytics nodes to
                  always fail if:</p><ul id="ul_p4d_cwn_bdb">
                  <li>a bucket is in the disconnected state, and </li>
                  <li>the Analytics nodes are at different DCP states. </li>
                </ul>In that case a common DCP state (required for rebalancing) cannot be achieved
                as no new DCP mutations will be received by the Analytics nodes.</entry>

              <entry><b>Summary</b>:  On Windows, a system limitation with the Analytics statistics
                may cause “system load” to have a negative value. Additionally, on Windows and mac
                OS, the statistics for “bytes read/sec” and “bytes written/sec” are not reported and
                always show zero.</entry>

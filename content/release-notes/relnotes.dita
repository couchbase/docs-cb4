              <entry>During rebalance, it was observed that sometimes in-flight mutations did not
                persist correctly. We’ve fixed the issue in this release and recommend upgrading to
                get the fix. <p>Since most Couchbase Server upgrade procedures involve rebalance,
                  some care must be taken when upgrading from a version prior to 5.1.1 to avoid
                  being affected by <xref href="https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29959"
                    format="html" scope="external">MB-29959</xref>. Specifically, graceful failover
                  and/or remove+rebalance should not be used to start this upgrade. As such, there
                  are a few best practice approaches: <ol>
                    <li>Add a net-new node of at least 5.1.1 to any existing cluster first. This new
                      node will become the orchestrator and any further rebalance will not be
                      affected. From then on, follow the instructions in <xref
                        href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade"
                        >Performing an Online Upgrade</xref>. </li>
                    <li>If a net-new node is not available, a hard failover can be performed on any
                      node, that node upgraded to 5.1.1 / 4.6.5 and then re-added to the cluster.
                      This is only required for the first node and, as per #1 above, any further
                      rebalance operations will not be affected. From then on, follow the
                      instructions in <xref
                        href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/online-upgrade"
                        >Performing an Online Upgrade</xref>.</li>
                    <li>As XDCR is not affected by MB-29959, upgrading one cluster in a
                      multi-cluster setup is also supported. Ensure that no writes are going to the
                      cluster during its upgrade unless following the approaches listed in #1 or #2
                      above. For instructions, see <xref
                        href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/intercluster"
                        >Upgrade Using Inter-cluster Replication</xref>.</li>
                    <li>Offline upgrade will not be affected. For instructions, see <xref
                        href="../install/upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/offline"
                        >Performing the Offline Upgrade</xref>.</li>
                  </ol></p><p>Which method is best for your cluster will depend on your architecture
                  and organization’s requirements (for example, SLAs, extra hardware/cluster
                  availability, and so on). Once a cluster is upgraded to 5.1.1 or later, this
                  guidance no longer applies and any supported upgrade method may be used going
                  forward.</p></entry>

              <entry>Couchbase Server version 5.0 introduced a new storage system “plasma” available only in the Enterprise Edition. When using the Enterprise Edition, you had a choice of “plasma” or “forestDB” for storage and the default was set to “plasma”. Since “plasma” storage was not available in the Community Edition, no storage was allocated when other services were started. This has been fixed and the default storage in the Community Edition now points to ForestDB. </entry>

              <entry>From the Query Monitoring tab, sorting the completed requests on the “run at” column did not appear to work as expected. This was because the “run at” column did not display the date, making the result of the sorting operation appear incorrect, since the same time on two different dates would appear in different spots on the list. This has been fixed by adding a clickable tooltip to the “run at” time which displays the complete time including the date. </entry>

              <entry>Couchbase Server version 5.0 introduced a new storage system “plasma” available only in the Enterprise Edition. When using the Enterprise Edition, you had a choice of “plasma” or “forestDB” for storage and the default was set to “plasma”. Since “plasma” storage was not available in the Community Edition, no storage was allocated when other services were started. This has been fixed and the default storage in the Community Edition now points to ForestDB. </entry>

              <entry>From the Query Monitoring tab, sorting the completed requests on the “run at” column did not appear to work as expected. This was because the “run at” column did not display the date, making the result of the sorting operation appear incorrect, since the same time on two different dates would appear in different spots on the list. This has been fixed by adding a clickable tooltip to the “run at” time which displays the complete time including the date. </entry>

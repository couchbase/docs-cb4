  <title>Beta features</title>
  <body>
    <p>Beta features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test
      functionality and provide feedback. If you want to provide feedback for an experimental
      feature in Couchbase, file an issue directly in our issue tracking system ticket. See <xref
        href="giving-feedback.dita"/> for details. For Q&amp;A, you can use the <xref
        href="https://forums.couchbase.com/" format="html" scope="external">Couchbase discussion
        forums</xref>. </p>
    <p>Beta features are not fully supported under Couchbase Subscription Level Agreements, may not
      be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. Because beta features are
      still under development, Couchbase does not guarantee the stability of such features. As a
      result, if you are using a beta feature, you may not be able to upgrade to subsequent releases
      of that feature. </p>
    <p>The following are beta features in Couchbase Server 4.0: <ul>
        <li>Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements - INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, MERGE, DELETE </li>
        <li>Prepared statements - All SDK platforms contain beta support for prepared
          statements.</li>
      </ul>

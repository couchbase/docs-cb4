    <section><title>Description</title>

      <p>Host names are provided when you install a Couchbase Server node, when you add it to an
        existing cluster for online upgrade, or via a REST API call. If a node restarts, any host
        name that you established is used. A host name cannot be provided for a node that is already
        part of a Couchbase Server cluster.</p> 
      
      <note type="important">Host names must be specified prior to being added to a cluster.</note>

    </section>


    <section><title>Response</title>
      
      <p>If you attempt to specify a host name once the node is in the cluster, the server rejects
        the request and returns the following:</p>
        
        <codeblock>error 400 reason: unknown ["Renaming is disallowed
        for nodes that are already part of a cluster"]</codeblock>

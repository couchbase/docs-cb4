    <li>For Ubuntu version 12.04 and Debian 7, you need OpenSSL 1.x. Install a specific OpenSSL
          dependency by running:<p><codeph> root-&gt; apt-get install libssl <varname>version</varname>
            </codeph></p></li>
     <li>To install, use the <cmdname>dpkg</cmdname> command-line tool using the
          <codeph>DEB</codeph> file that you downloaded. The following example uses
          <cmdname>dpkg</cmdname> for installation:
          <codeblock>dpkg -i couchbase-server version.deb</codeblock><p>where
            <varname>version</varname> is the version number of the downloaded package.</p><p>After
          the <cmdname>dpkg</cmdname> command is executed, Couchbase Server starts automatically and
          is configured to automatically start during boot under the 2, 3, 4, and 5 run levels.

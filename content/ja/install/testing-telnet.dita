  <title>Testing with <cmdname>telnet</cmdname></title>
  <shortdesc>The simplest method to determine whether Couchbase Server is running is to use
      <cmdname>Telnet</cmdname> to connect to the server with the memcached text
    protocol.</shortdesc>
  <body>


    <p><cmdname>Telnet</cmdname> must be installed on your server to connect to Couchbase Server
      using this method. It is supplied as standard on most platforms, or can be obtained as a
      separate package and installed via your operating system's standard package manager.</p>

    <note type="note">You do not need to use the <cmdname>Telnet</cmdname> method for communicating
      with your server within your application. Instead, use one of the Couchbase Server SDKs. </note>

    <p>Connect to the server (connecting to the legacy memcached protocol using Moxi):</p>
    <codeblock>&gt; telnet localhost1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.</codeblock>
    <p>Make sure it is responding (stats is a great way to check basic health):</p>
    <codeblock>stats
STAT delete_misses 0
STAT ep_io_num_write 0
STAT rejected_conns 0
...
STAT time 1286678223
...
STAT curr_items_tot 0
...
STAT threads 4
STAT pid 23871
...
END</codeblock>
    <p>Put a key in:</p>
    <codeblock>set test_key 0 0 1
a
STORED</codeblock>
    <p>Retrieve the key:</p>
    <codeblock>get test_key
VALUE test_key 0 1
a
END</codeblock>
    <p>Disconnect:</p>
    <codeblock>quit
Connection closed by foreign host.
&gt;</codeblock>
    <p>All of the memcached protocols commands will work through <cmdname>Telnet</cmdname>.</p>

  <title>Upgrading a Single Node</title>
  <shortdesc>To upgrade a single Couchbase Server node,  back up your data and then install the
    upgrade package.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Use the <xref href="../cli/cbbackup-tool.dita#cbbackup-tool">cbbackup tool</xref> to back up
      your data.</p>
    <note type="note">Steps for upgrading a Couchbase Server node explained in this section are identical for an
      online upgrade (for a node that has been removed from the cluster) or an offline upgrade (for
      a node that has not yet been added to the cluster).</note>
 
    
    <ol>
        <li>Download the Couchbase Server package.</li>
      <li>Back up the cluster data.</li>
      <li>Back up the server-specific configuration files. 
        While the upgrade scripts perform a backup of the configuration and data files, 
        make your own backup of these files as best practice. 
        The configuration files are found in <filepath>/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/ </filepath>by default.
      </li>
        <li>Stop the Couchbase Server service.</li>
        <li>Check your hostname configuration. If you have deployed Couchbase Server in a cloud
          service, or if you are using hostnames rather than IP addresses, you must verify that the 
          hostname has been configured correctly and is resolvable before performing the upgrade. </li>
      <li>Perform the upgrade installation for your platform; see the <xref
          href="installation.dita#topic_o2n_51k_5s"/>section appropriate for your platform for
        detailed installation instructions.</li>

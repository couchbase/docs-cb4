 <title>Concurrent Document Mutations</title>
 <shortdesc>You can use the CAS value to control how concurrent document modifications are
        handled</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The <term>CAS</term> is a value representing the current state of an item. Each time the item
            is modified, its CAS changes.</p>
        <p>The CAS value itself is returned as part of a document’s metadata whenever a document is
            accessed (for example, in the Python client, getting an item returns a
                <codeph>ValueResult</codeph>, the <codeph>ValueResult</codeph> contains the value
            (i.e. the JSON document) as well as the CAS.</p>
        <p>CAS is an acronym for <i>Compare And Swap</i>, and is known as a form of optimistic
            locking. The CAS can be supplied by applications to mutation operations
                (<apiname>insert</apiname>, <apiname>upsert</apiname>, <apiname>replace</apiname>).
            When applications provide the CAS, server will check the application-provided version of
            CAS against its own version of the CAS:<ul id="ul_cxq_3ts_zs">
                <li>If the two CAS values match (they compare successfully), then the mutation
                    operation succeeds.</li>
                <li>If the two CAS values differ, then the mutation operation fails </li>
            </ul></p>
        <section><title>Demonstration</title>The following demonstrates how the server handles CAS.
            A use case for employing the CAS is when adding a new field to an existing document. At
            the application level, this requires the following steps:<ol id="ul_ehb_nts_zs">
                <li>Read entire document.</li>
                <li>Perform modification locally.</li>
                <li>Store new document to server.</li>
            </ol>

                application instances: <table frame="all" rowsep="2" colsep="2"

                that <codeph>field1</codeph> is not present, even though the application inserted it
                into the document. The reason is because the replace on Thread #2 happened to run
                after the replace on Thread #1, however Thread #1’s replace was executed after
                Thread #2’s get: Since the local version of the document on Thread #2 did not
                contain field1 (because Thread #1’s update was not stored on the server yet), by
                executing the replace, it essentially overrode the replace performed by Thread
                #1.</p><table id="table_jvd_b5s_zs">

            <p>In the prior example, we saw that concurrent updates to the same document may result
				in some updates being lost. This is not because Couchbase itself has lost the updates,

            <title>Handling CAS errors</title>
            <p>If the item’s CAS has changed since the last operation performed by the current
                client (i.e. the document has been changed by another client), the CAS used by the
                application is considered <i>stale</i>. If a <i>stale</i> CAS is sent to the server
                (via one of the mutation commands, as above), the server will reply with an error,
                and the Couchbase SDK will accordingly return this error to the application (either
                via return code or exception, depending on the language).<note>The error returned
                    for a CAS mismatch is the same that is returned when trying to insert an
                    already-existing document. The error code is not ambiguous since the CAS option
                    is only accepted (and only makes sense) for documents which already
                    exist.</note></p>
            <p>How to handle this error depends on the application logic. If the application wishes
                to simply insert a new property within the document (which is not dependent on other
                properties within the document), then it may simply retry the read-update cycle by
                retrieving the item (and thus getting the new CAS), performing the local
                modification and then uploading the change to the server. For example, if a document
                represents a user, and the application is simply updating a user’s information (like
                an email field), the method to update this information may look like
                this:<codeblock>def update_email(cb, user_id, email):
    while True:
        result = cb.get(user_id)
        user_doc = result.value
        user_doc['email'] = email
        cb.upsert(user_id, user_doc, cas=result.cas)
        break # Mutation succeeded
    except KeyExistsError:
        # This means the CAS has been modified. We still need to
        # insert the email field, but do not want to override new changes
        continue</codeblock></p>
            <p>Sometimes more logic is needed when performing updates, for example, if a property is
                mutually exclusive with another property; only one or the other can exist, but not
                both.</p>

            <title>Performance considerations</title>
            <p>CAS operations incur no additional overhead. CAS values are always returned from the
                server for each operation. Comparing CAS at the server involves a simple integer
                comparison which incurs no overhead.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>CAS value format</title>
            <p>The CAS value should be treated as an opaque object at the application level. No
                assumptions should be made with respect to how the value is changed (for example, it
                is wrong to assume that it is a simple counter value).</p>
            <p>At the protocol level, the CAS is represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer. Some SDKs
                will expose this type as a numeric type, while others (specifically, languages which
                lack native 64 bit integer support) will expose them as a string or buffer.</p>

	<title>Travel app data model</title>
	<shortdesc>The data model for the travel app uses several distinct document types: airline, route,
		airport and landmark.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>

<p>The model for each kind of document contains: <ul>
                <li>A key that acts as a primary key</li>
                <li>An <codeph>id</codeph> field that identifies the document</li>
                <li>A <codeph>type</codeph> field that identifies the kind of document</li>
            </ul></p>
		<p>The following figure illustrates the relationship between the different kinds of documents. It
            shows the primary key, ID, and type fields that each document has, plus a few
            representative fields in each type of document.</p>

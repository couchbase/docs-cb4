    Amazon VPC.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <p>For the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC), security is provided with: <ul>
        <li>Network Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are an optional layer of security that acts as a
          firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet.</li>
        <li>Security groups, which act as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and
          outbound traffic. </li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>To ensure security: <ul>
        <li>On the host level, you can set individual SSL keys using a bashing host. Make sure that
          the access to your Couchbase instance is logged and audited through Amazonâ€™s logging
          capabilities.</li>
        <li>Obtain customer generated key pairs.</li>
        <li>Set up an outbound instance of a firewall in the VPC.</li>
        <li>To protect your access, sign your calls using a certificate or a customer key. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

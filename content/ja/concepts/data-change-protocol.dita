 <title>Data Change Protocol</title>
 <shortdesc>Data Change Protocol (DCP) is a high-performance streaming protocol that communicates
        the state of the data using an ordered change log with sequence numbers. It is a generic
        protocol designed for keeping a consumer of the Data Service up to date.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>DCP is robust and resilient in the face of transitory errors. For example, if a stream is interrupted, DCP resumes from exactly the point of its last successful update once connectivity resumes. DCP provides version histories and rollbacks that provide a snapshot of the data. Snapshots can be used to create a brand new replica or catch up an interrupted or partially built node.</p>
  
  <p>Couchbase Server leverages DCP internally and externally for several different purposes. Within
   Couchbase Server, DCP is used to create replicas of data within and between clusters, maintain
   indexes (both local and global), backups, etc. DCP also feeds most <xref
    href="../connectors/intro.dita#concept_iy1_2rg_2s"/>, which are integrations with external
   systems such as Hadoop, Kafka or Elasticsearch. Some of these connectors leverage DCP directly or
   connect to Couchbase Serverâ€™s <xref
    href="../ha-dr/ha-dr-intro.dita#concept_rwn_1vf_ps/geo-dist-and-xdcr">XDCR</xref> functionality
   to keep the external systems in sync by acting like Couchbase Server nodes.</p>

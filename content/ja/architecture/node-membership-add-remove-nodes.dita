 <title>Node membership: adding and removing nodes without downtime</title>
 <shortdesc>The Cluster Manager is responsible for cluster membership. When the topology of a cluster changes, the Cluster Manager walks through a set of carefully orchestrated operations to redistribute the load while keeping the existing workload running without a hiccup.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The following workflow describes the high-level operations to add a new node: <ol>
   <li>The Cluster Manager ensures the new nodes inherit the cluster configuration. </li>
   <li>In order to redistribute the data to the new nodes,  the Cluster Manager initiates rebalance and recalculates the vBucket map. </li>
   <li>The vBuckets that are identified to move to the new nodes initialize DCP replication to build new copies of the vBuckets on the new nodes.</li>
   <li>As the new vBuckets on the new nodes catch up, the Cluster Manager ensures that the new vBucket map and cluster topology is communicated to all the existing nodes and clients.  This process is repeated until rebalance operation completes running. </li>
  </ol> 
</p>
  <p>Removing one or more nodes from the cluster involves a similar workflow, except that in this case the rebalance operation rebuilds the missing replica vBuckets. </p>

  <title>Index Aliases</title>
  <body>
    <p>An <term>index alias</term> is a special type of index that's a "virtual index" that points to other, real indexes.</p><p>Similar to a symbolic link in a filesystem, an index alias allows a naming level of indirection, so that applications can refer to a stable name (the alias' name) while administrators can dynamically re-target or re-point the index alias to different, real indexes.</p>
    <p>Similar to an email list alias, too, an index alias in FTS can also "fan-out" and refer to multiple, real indexes. Aliases can also refer to other aliases. A query on an index alias will be scatter-gathered by FTS to all of the actual, real indexes and FTS will provide merged results from those scatter-gathered queries.</p>

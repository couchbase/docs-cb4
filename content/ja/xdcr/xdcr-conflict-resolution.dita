  <title>XDCR conflict resolution</title>
  <shortdesc>Conflict resolution makes XDCR an ideal solution for high availability use cases. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Failing over to a secondary cluster under cluster-wide or partial failures is critical for
      providing a full availability on the database tier. Therefore, XDCR is often used as an
      availability solution since the RevID-based model (a model based on a revision ID) behaves
      ideally under failover conditions. </p>
<p>In addition to the RevID type of conflict resolution, Couchbase Server implements Timestamp. </p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Revision ID</dt>
          <dd>The default resolution type is Revision ID-based. Enable Revision ID at the Couchbase
          bucket level during the initial setup and then change it if needed at a later time.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl>

    
    <dl>
      <dlentry>
        <dt>Timestamp</dt>
        <dd>When the system detects  identical
          revision IDs or identical timestamps while resolving conflicts, it allows the larger value
          to win after comparing them. </dd>
        <dd>The order for comparing values in the system is as follows: <ol>
            <li>CAS (Create and Set) Value</li>
            <li>Document flag</li>
            <li>Expiration TTL (Time to Live) value</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
      </dlentry>
    </dl>

  <title>XDCR flush requests</title>
  <shortdesc>A flush operation deletes data on a local cluster. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>XDCR does not replicate flush requests to delete the entire content of the Couchbase bucket
      to the remote cluster. The flush option is disabled if an active outbound replica stream is
      configured.</p>
    
    <p>If the Couchbase bucket needs to be flushed either on the source or destination of an XDCR
      replication, use the following operation sequence: <ol>
        <li>Delete the XDCR replication.</li>
        <li>Flush the Couchbase bucket as normal.</li>
        <li>Recreate the XDCR replication.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>Deleting and recreating the XDCR replication will reset the replication and resend the data
      to the target cluster, unless the data has been synchronized.</p>
    
        <note type="important">When replicating to or from a Couchbase bucket, do not flush that
      bucket on the source or destination cluster. Flushing causes the Couchbase bucket's state to
      become temporarily inaccessible and results in a <systemoutput>not_found</systemoutput> error.
      This error suspends replication. </note>

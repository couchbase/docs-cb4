  <title>Hard Failover</title><shortdesc>Hard failover immediately fails over nodes from clusters. Automatic failover is a hard
    failover</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>During failover, replica vBuckets are promoted to active vBuckets and active vBuckets on the
      failed-over node are transitioned to replica vBuckets. </p>
    <p>After a node is failed over, it can be added back to the cluster via delta or full recovery.
      When a node is added back to the cluster after the failover, the replica vBuckets on the
      failed-over node are resynchronized and promoted back to active.</p>
      
      <p>Topology changes after a failover, such as adding, removing, or failing over a server,
      initiate a different rebalance operation. </p>
      <p>Typically, the hard failover is used when the node is in a bad state. The following
      conditions are usually present:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The node is not healthy.</li>
        <li>Each active vBucket does not have an equivalent replica bucket.</li>
        <li>No replica buckets are present.</li>
      </ul>

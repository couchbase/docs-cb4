 <title>Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</title>
 <shortdesc>Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) improves performance and throughput for mission-critical
    systems by enabling independent scaling of data, query and indexing workloads. </shortdesc>

<p>Historically scale-out and scale-up have been the scalability model for databases. Both models
        are useful, and Couchbase and other products take advantage of both models. However, there
        are unique ways to combine and mix these models in a single cluster to maximize throughput
        and latencies. With MDS, admins can achieve both the existing homogenous scalability model
        and the new independent scalability model.</p>
  </section>
   
   
   
  <section><title>Homogenous Scaling Model</title> To better understand the new multi-dimensional
      scaling model, it is beneficial to take a look at the current homogenous scaling model.

      cluster made up of the homogeneous set of nodes. Each node that does the core processing takes
      a similar slice of the work and has the same HW resources.<p>This model is available through
        MDS and is simple to implement but has a few drawbacks:<ul>
          <li>Components processing core data operations (inserts, updates, deletes), index
            maintenance or executing queries compete and interfere with each other.</li>
          <li>It is impossible to fine-tune each component because each of them has different
            demands on hardware resources. While the core data operations can benefit greatly from
            scale-out with smaller commodity nodes, many low latency queries do not always benefit
            from wider fan-out. </li>
        </ul></p></section>
  <section><title>Independent Scaling Model</title>MDS is designed to minimize interference between
      services. When you separate the competing workloads into independent service and isolate the
      services in different zones, interference among them is minimized. The figure below
      demonstrates a deployment topology that can be achieved with MDS. In this topology, each
      service is deployed to an independent zone within the cluster.<p><image

          width="600"/></p><p>Each service zone within a cluster (data, query, and index services)
        can now scale independently so that the best computational capacity is provided for each of
        them.</p><p><image href="../admin/picts/mds-scaling.png" id="image_gwy_r52_2t" align="left"
          width="600"/></p>In the figure above, the green additions signify the direction of scaling
      for each service. In this case, query and index services scale up over the fewer sets of
      powerful nodes and data service scale out with an additional node.</section>

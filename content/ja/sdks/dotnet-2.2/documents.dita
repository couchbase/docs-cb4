	<title>Working with documents</title>
	<shortdesc>Couchbase Server is a document database at its core. Keys and values are stored as
		JSON documents if they are in fact valid JSON; otherwise, they are stored as binary blobs. </shortdesc>


	<conbody>
		<p>In most cases, you will want to store documents as JSON. To make it easier to work with JSON
			documents, we added document-centric APIs to our SDKs. This section contains information
			about storing, deleting, and retrieving documents using these APIs.</p>

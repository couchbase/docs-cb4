	<title>Handling timeouts</title>
	<shortdesc>Timeouts occur when an operation that was performed is not able to be processed fast enough
		due to connection issues to the appropriate Couchbase Server node, or due to high server
		loads.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
		<p>Internally, the SDK will attempt to retry an operation internally upon recoverable
			failures such as timeouts. However, if there is a persistent issue, a timeout will be
			emitted to the client. When this occurs you should push this error back upon the request
			initiator (the front end) to be attempted at some later date. 
			
			<note>Due to nature of the
				Couchbase system, performing manual retries upon receiving a timeout is not suggested
				because it will likely simply aggravate whatever issue caused the initial error.</note></p>

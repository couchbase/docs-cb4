	<title>Handling Timeouts</title>
	<shortdesc />
	<conbody>
		<p>Timeouts are encountered when the time allowed to complete an operation (typically waiting
			for the response to arrive over the network) is exceeded. When a timeout is encountered it
			is usually because a resource is either congested, unresponsive, or has been taken down.
			The library returns status codes of <codeph>LCB_ETIMEDOUT</codeph> in an operation callback
			if the operation failed before a response could arrive.</p>

		<p>Due to internal retrying within the library, performing the operation again after a timeout
			is not suggested.</p>

	<title>Retrieving documents</title>
	<shortdesc>Describes how to load documents using the various <codeph>get()</codeph> methods.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>

		<section>
			<title>Regular reads</title>

			<p>Reading a document is done by using the <codeph>get()</codeph> method. This can be done by either passing in the <codeph>id</codeph> of the <codeph>Document</codeph> or a <codeph>Document</codeph> itself (where the <codeph>id</codeph> is taken from).</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Observable<JsonDocument> loadedFromId = bucket.get("id");
Observable<JsonDocument> loadedFromDoc = bucket.get(JsonDocument.create("id"));]]></codeblock>

			<p>Both methods have the same effect. The latter method is helpful if you are already dealing
				with <codeph>Document</codeph> instances in your code and you don't want to extract the
					<codeph>ID</codeph> out of them on your own.</p>

			<p>When only the ID is passed in, there is no way to figure out which <codeph>Document</codeph>
				type should be used, so <codeph>JsonDocument</codeph> is selected as a sensible default.
				If you want to override this, you can pass in a specific <codeph>Document</codeph> type
				like this:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[Observable<LegacyDocument> loaded = bucket.get("legacyId", LegacyDocument.class);]]></codeblock>

			<p>If the document is not found, an empty <codeph>Observable</codeph> is returned. This aligns
				with how <codeph>Observable</codeph> objects are supposed to work by contract, but also makes
				it easier to deal with the implementation later. If no document is returned, the
				subsequent operations are just not executed, which avoids having null checks all over
				the place (if say, a <codeph>Document</codeph> would be returned but with the content
				set to <codeph>null</codeph>).</p>

			<p>If you are dealing with blocking code, use <codeph>singleOrDefault()</codeph> to avoid a
					<codeph>NoSuchElementException</codeph> to be thrown. You can either use a
					<codeph>Document</codeph> populated with default settings or just
					<codeph>null</codeph>, which can be checked later:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[JsonDocument found = bucket.get("notexisting").toBlocking().singleOrDefault(null);
if (found == null) {
    // doc not found
} else {
    // doc found
}]]></codeblock>

			<title>Reading from replica</title>

			<p>A regular read always reads the document from its master node. If this node is down or not available, the document cannot be loaded. Reading from replica allows you to load the document from one or more replica nodes instead.</p>

			<p><note>When replica reads are used, always use them under the assumption that the data returned is stale. There is no way to guarantee that the data is up-to-date on the replica node unless the proper durability requirements have been set and succeeded on write operations. Only use replica reads if you understand the implications.</note></p>

			<p>You can either read the data from one specific replica or all of the available replicas:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// Read from all available replicas and the master node and return all responding
bucket.getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.ALL);

// Read only from the first replica
bucket.getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.FIRST);

// Read only from the second replica
bucket.getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.SECOND);

// Read only from the third replica
bucket.getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.THIRD);]]></codeblock>

			<p>Note that if <codeph>ReplicaMode.ALL</codeph> is used, requests are sent to the master node
				and all configured replicas. The main goal is to get responses back as fast as possible,
				but because more requests are sent, more responses can arrive. You can use this to
				either compare all of the responding documents and draw conclusions from that, or just
				pick the first one arriving:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[bucket
    .getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.ALL)
    .first()
    .subscribe();]]></codeblock>

    		<p>In addition, you can add operations to filter based on some of your assumptions. Imagine
				you have a <codeph>version</codeph> field in your document and you want to only use the
				replica information if it this specific version:</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[bucket
    .getFromReplica("id", ReplicaMode.ALL)
    .filter(document -> document.content().getInt("version") > 5)
    .first()
    .subscribe();]]></codeblock>

			<title>Reading and locking</title>

			<p>Reading and locking works very similar to a regular read, but in addition the <codeph>Document</codeph> is <b>write locked</b> (not read locked) on the server side for the given amount of time.</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// Get and lock for 10 seconds
Observable<JsonDocument> doc = bucket.getAndLock("id", 10);]]></codeblock>

			<p>
				<note>You can only write lock a document for a maximum of 30 seconds. If an invalid lock time
					(less than 0 or greater than 30 seconds) is provided, 15 seconds is used as the
					default.</note>
			</p>

			<p>The <codeph>Document</codeph> is unlocked under the following conditions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <codeph>unlock()</codeph> command is used.</li>
				<li>The <codeph>Document</codeph> is replaced with the correct CAS value.</li>
				<li>30 seconds are over and the server unlocks it for you.</li>
			</ul>

			<title>Reading and touching</title>

			<p>Reading and touching works very similar to a regular read, but it also refreshes the expiration time of the document to the specified value.</p>

<codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// Get and set the new expiration time to 4 seconds
Observable<JsonDocument> doc = bucket.getAndTouch("id", 4);]]></codeblock>

			<p>You can also use the <codeph>touch()</codeph> command if you do not want to read the document and just refresh its expiration time.</p>

			<p>If you specify an expiration time greater than 30 days in seconds (60 seconds * 60 minutes *
				24 hours * 30 days = 2,592,000 seconds) it is considered an absolute time stamp instead
				of a relative one.</p>

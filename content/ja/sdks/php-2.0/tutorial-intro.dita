	<title>Tutorial</title><shortdesc>The PHP SDK tutorial shows you how to build a complete web application that interacts with
		Couchbase Server. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The PHP SDK tutorial uses a very powerful toolchain consisting of <xref
				href="https://getcomposer.org/" format="html" scope="external">Composer</xref>, <xref
				href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/" format="html" scope="external">Silex</xref> and
				<xref href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" format="html" scope="external">Twig</xref> to
			build a solid web application fast while not losing the focus on showing you how to work
			with the PHP SDK.</p>
		<p>The tutorial uses the <codeph>beer-sample</codeph> data set that is provided with Couchbase
			Server to create an app that displays and manages beers and breweries. Along the way youâ€™ll
			pick up concepts on querying Couchbase Server by keys or through views.</p>
		<p>The full code sample is available on <xref
				href="https://github.com/couchbaselabs/beersample-php" scope="external" format="html"
				>GitHub</xref>. You can clone the repository and work from there if you just want to see
			the finished application or get started quickly.</p>
		<p>Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies in place:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP 5.3 or later. The PHP SDK itself requires PHP 5.3 or later, and most of the other
				dependencies require PHP 5.3.</li> 
			<li><p><xref href="http://www.couchbase.com/develop/php/current" scope="external" format="html"
						>Couchbase PHP SDK 2.0</xref> : Install the appropriate .so or .dll file,
					depending on your platform. Earlier versions of the SDK are not capable enough
					becauseit uses the new Couchbase Server view-related functionality.</p></li>
			<li><p><xref href="http://getcomposer.org/" scope="external" format="html">Composer</xref> : An
					excellent dependency manager for PHP and supported by major libraries and frameworks
					such as <xref href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" format="html" scope="external"
						>Doctrine</xref> or <xref href="http://symfony.com/" format="html"
						scope="external">Symfony</xref>.</p></li>
		</ul>

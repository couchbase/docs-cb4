			<p>Most PHP data types that can be serialized via the JSON functions are supported by
				default. Recursive structures cannot be serialized. All textual data is represented
				by UTF-8 when stored to Couchbase Server. You may alternatively implement your own
				transcoders which modify the method by which your documents are serialized to
				Couchbase. The following is an example of a transcoder which will transcode all
				documents as UTF-8 encoded JSON documents.</p>

  return array(json_encode($value), 0, 0);
}, function($value, $flags, $datatype) {
  return json_decode($value, true);

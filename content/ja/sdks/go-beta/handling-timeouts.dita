	<title>Handling timeouts</title>
	<shortdesc>Timeouts occur when an operation cannot be processed fast enough.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>An operation cannot be processed fast enough either due to connection issues to the appropriate
			Couchbase Server node or due to high server loads. The SDK will attempt to retry an
			operation internally upon recoverable failures such as timeouts. However, if there is a
			persistent issue, a timeout will be emitted to the client. When this occurs, you should
			push this error back upon the request initiator (the front end) to be attempted at some
			later date. <note>Due to nature of the Couchbase system, it is not suggested to perform
				manual retries upon receiving a timeout because it will likely simply aggravate
				whatever issue caused the initial error.</note></p>

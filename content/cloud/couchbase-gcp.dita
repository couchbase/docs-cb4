  <title>Google Cloud Platform and Couchbase</title>
  <body>
    <p>Couchbase partners with Google to provide a packaged solution on Google Cloud Launcher,
      Google Deployment Manager (DM) templates, and best practices. These enable you to be up and
      running with Couchbase on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) quickly and easily. </p>
    <p>The Deployment Manager (DM) templates are developed in close collaboration with the GCP
      Engineering team to adopt the latest features. These templates leverage Googleâ€™s globally flat
      network for extremely secure geographical replication. Couchbase is the first software vendor
      to leverage Instance Group Manager (IGM) in a Cloud Launcher template, simplifying cluster
      management and scaling while improving resilience to hardware failures. </p>
    <p> Couchbase is available through Google Cloud Launcher with hourly pricing or through a Bring
      Your Own License (BYOL) model. For more information, see <xref
        href="couchbase-gcp-cloud-launcher.dita#topic_rfg_qjt_xs"/>. <!--You can also deploy Couchbase
      with the DM templates we host on GitHub. For more information, see <xref
        href="#topic_ghd_55f_nbb/gcp-cli" format="dita"/>.--> </p>
    <p> Best practices when deploying on GCP are available here. For other resources detailing the
      Google and Couchbase partnership, see the <xref

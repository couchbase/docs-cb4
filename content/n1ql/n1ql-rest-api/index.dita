	<title>N1QL REST API</title>
	<shortdesc>N1QL provides a REST API to enable clients to execute N1QL statements. The REST API runs
		synchronously, so once execution of the statement in the request is started, results are
		streamed back to the client, terminating when execution of the statement finishes. In this
		section, you will find information about the REST endpoints, request and response
		parameters, and examples.  </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>The REST endpoints are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<codeph>http://<varname>node</varname>:8093/query/service</codeph></li>
			<li>
				<codeph>https://<varname>node</varname>:18093/query/service</codeph> (for secure
				access)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>where <varname>node</varname> is the host name or IP address of a computer running the N1QL
			query engine.</p>

		<p>The N1QL REST API query service allows you to execute a N1QL statement.</p>
		<p>See  <xref href="examplesrest.dita"/> for REST API samples.</p>
<section>For the Request specification, see <xref
				href="../n1ql-intro/query-settings.dita#topic_wk1_5v3_t5/table_o1l_v3j_c1b"
			/>.</section>
		<section> <title>Response</title>
			<p>This section has two subsections: Response HTTP Status Codes and Response Body.</p>
			<dl>
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Response HTTP status code</dt>
					<dd><p>
						<b>Normal status code:</b>
					</p>
						<p><b>200 OK</b>- The request completed with or without errors. Any errors or warnings
							that occurred during the request will be in the response body. </p>
						
						<p>
							<b>Possible error codes:</b>
						</p>
						
						<p><b>400 Bad Request</b>- The request cannot be processed for one of the following
							reasons: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>The statement contains a N1QL syntax error.</li>
							<li>The request has a missing or unrecognized HTTP parameter.</li>
							<li>The request is badly formatted (for example, the request body contains a JSON syntax
								error).</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>401 Unauthorized</b>- The credentials provided with the request are missing or
							invalid.</p>
						<p><b>403 Forbidden</b>- There is a read-only violation. Either there was an attempt to create
							or update in a GET request or a POST request where <codeph>readonly</codeph> is set
							or the client does not have the authorization to modify an object (index, keyspace or
							namespace) in the statement.</p>
						<p><b>404 Not Found</b>- The statement in the request references an invalid namespace or
							keyspace.</p>
						<p><b>405 Method Not Allowed</b>- The REST method type in the request is
							unsupported.</p>
						<p><b>409 Conflict</b>- There is an attempt to create an object (keyspace or index) that
							already exists.</p>
						<p><b>410 Gone</b>- The server is shutting down gracefully. Previously made requests are
							being completed, but no new requests are being accepted.</p>
						<p><b>500 Internal Server Error</b>- There was an unforeseen problem processing the
							request.</p>
						<p><b>503 Service Unavailable</b>- There is an issue (that is possibly temporary)
							preventing the request being processed; the request queue is full or the data store
							is not accessible.</p></dd>

		<section><title>Request error and warning format</title>
			<p>Errors and warnings have the following format:</p>
			<codeblock>{
	"code" : int,
	"msg" : string,
	"name": string,
	"sev" : int,
	"temp" : bool
}			</codeblock>
			<p><b>code:</b> A unique number for the error or warning. The code ranges are partitioned
				by component. The codes can also include parts that indicate severity and transience.
				<b>code</b> is always present in every condition returned in the Query REST API or
				captured in a log.</p>
			<p><b>msg:</b>A detailed description of the condition. <b>msg</b> is always present in
				every condition returned in the Query REST API or captured in a log. </p>
			<p> The following elements are optional and can be present in a condition returned in the
				Query REST API or captured in a log. Additional elements not listed here might also be
				present. Clients and consumers of the REST API or the logs must accommodate any
				additional elements. </p>
			<p><b>name:</b>Unique name that has a 1:1 mapping to the <b>code</b>. Uniquely identifies
				the condition. <b>name</b> is helpful for pattern matching and can have meaning making
				it more memorable than the code). The name should be fully qualified. Here are some
				examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<codeph>indexing.scan.io_failure</codeph>
				</li>
				<li>
					<codeph>query.execute.index_not_found</codeph>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>sev:</b>One of the following N1QL severity levels (listed in order of severity):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Severe</li>
				<li>Error</li>
				<li>Warn</li>
				<li>Info</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>temp:</b>Indicates if the condition is transient (for example, the queue is full). If the
				value is <b>false</b>, it tells clients and users that a retry without modification
				produces the same condition.</p>

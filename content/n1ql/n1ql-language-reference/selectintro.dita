  <shortdesc>With the SELECT statement, you can query and manipulate JSON data. You can select, join, project, nest, unnest, group, and sort in a single SELECT statement.
  </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The SELECT statement takes a set of JSON documents from keyspaces as its input, manipulates
      it and returns a set of JSON documents in the result array. Since the schema for JSON
      documents is flexible, JSON documents in the resultset have flexible schema as well.</p>
    <p>A simple query in N1QL consists of three parts: <ul id="ul_inf_qjk_dx">
        <li>SELECT: specifies the projection, which is the part of the document that is to be
          returned. </li>
        <li>FROM: specifies the keyspaces to work with. </li>
        <li>WHERE: specifies the query criteria (filters or predicates) that the results must
          satisfy.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To query on a keyspace, you must either specify the document keys or use an index on the
      keyspace. </p>
    <p>The following example uses an index to query the keyspace for airports that are in the
      America/Anchorage timezone and at an altitude of 2100ft or higher, and returns an array with
      the airport name and city name for each airport that satisfies the
      conditions.<codeblock spectitle="Query">SELECT t.airportname, t.city
FROM   `travel-sample` t
WHERE  type = "airport" 
       AND tz = "America/Anchorage" 
       AND geo.alt >= 2100;</codeblock><codeblock spectitle="Results">[
   {
         "airportname": "Anaktuvuk Pass Airport",
         "city": "Anaktuvuk Pass",
   }
]</codeblock></p>
    <p>The next example queries the keyspace using the document key
        "<userinput>airport_3469</userinput>".
      <codeblock spectitle="Query">SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` USE KEYS "airport_3469";</codeblock><codeblock spectitle="Result">[

    <p>With projections, you retrieve just the fields that you need and not the entire document.
      This is especially useful when querying for a large dataset as it results in shorter
      processing times and better performance.</p>
    <p>The SELECT statement provides a variety of data processing capabilities such as <xref

 <section><title>SELECT Statement Processing</title>
   <p>The SELECT statement queries a keyspace and returns a JSON array that contains zero or more objects.</p>
   <p>The following diagram shows the query execution workflow at a high level and illustrates the
        interaction with the query, index, and data services. <fig id="fig_knp_lkk_dx">
          <title>Query Execution Workflow</title>
          <image placement="break" href="images/query_execution.png" width="570"
            id="image_lnp_lkk_dx"/>
        </fig></p>
   <p>The SELECT statement is executed as a sequence of steps. Each step in the process produces result objects that are then used as inputs in the next step until all steps in the process are complete. While the workflow diagram shows all the possible phases a query goes through before returning a result, the clauses and predicates in a query decide the phases and the number of times that the query goes through. For example, sort phase can be skipped when there is no ORDER BY clause in the query; scan-fetch-join phase will execute multiple times for correlated subqueries.</p>
   <p>The following diagram shows the possible elements and operations during query execution.
        <fig id="fig_t4d_c35_gx">
          <title>Query Execution Phases</title>

            id="image_u4d_c35_gx"/>
        </fig></p>
   <p>The possible elements and operations in a query include: <ul>
     <li>Specifying the keyspace that is queried.</li>
          <li>Specifying the document keys or using indexes to access the documents. </li>
          <li>Fetching the data from the data service. </li>
          <li>Filtering the result objects by specifying conditions in the WHERE clause. </li>
          <li>Removing duplicate result objects from the resultset by using the DISTINCT clause. </li>
          <li>Grouping and aggregating the result objects. </li>
          <li>Ordering (sorting) items in the resultset in the order specified by the ORDER BY
            expression list. </li>
          <li>Skipping the first <varname>n</varname> items in the result object as specified by the
            OFFSET clause. </li>
          <li>Limiting the number of results returned using the LIMIT clause. </li>

            satisfied by the documents to be included in the resultset, and the resultset is
            returned as an array of airports that satisfy the condition. <note>The keys in the

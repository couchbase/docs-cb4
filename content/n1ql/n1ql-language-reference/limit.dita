<codeblock>LIMIT expression</codeblock>
  <p>The LIMIT clause specifies the maximum number of objects that can be returned in a result set
      by SELECT. A negative value or a value greater than 9223372036854775295 (result of
        <fn>math.MaxInt64</fn><codeph>- 512</codeph>) is considered as LIMIT 0. </p>

   <codeblock>SELECT fname, age
     FROM tutorial
          ORDER BY age
              LIMIT 2

     {
       "age": 20,
       "fname": "Harry"
     }
   ]
 }    </codeblock>  
   <p>Note that the result set does not exceed the number specified by the limit clause. For example when deleting items with limit 10, the query may delete only 6 items. </p>

      <title>Example1</title>
      <p>Here is an example of aggregating using correlated subquery expression in projection. This
        query finds the top 3 overall rated hotels. The subquery in the projection finds the average
        overall rating across all rating of the given hotel document <codeph>t</codeph>. Note that
        the subquery uses nested paths in the FROM clause.</p>

      <p>The following query shows how to use correlated subquery expression in projection with

      <p>This example shows usage of subquery expressions in MERGE statement. This query uses

        value of vacancy to a new attribute old_vacancy.</p>

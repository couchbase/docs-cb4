    <title>Group By and Aggregate Performance</title>
    <shortdesc>N1QL Pushdowns optimize the performance of N1QL queries by supporting GROUP BY and
        Aggregate expressions.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p><i>(Introduced in Couchbase Server 5.5 - Enterprise Edition)</i></p>
        <section id="Overview">
            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>This features improves performance of N1QL queries with aggregations and GROUP BY
                execution. </p>
            <p>After the optimizer selects an index for a query block, it attempts the two
                optimizations below:<ul id="ul_pkn_zcq_xcb">
                    <li>Pagination optimization, by pushing the OFFSET and LIMIT parameters to the
                        index scan.</li>
                    <li>Grouping and aggregation pushdown to the indexer (introduced in Couchbase
                        5.5).</li>
                </ul>Prior to Couchbase 5.5, even when a query with aggregate and/or GROUP BY is
                covered by an index, the query fetched all relevant data from the indexer and group
                the data within the query engine. With this enhancement, the query intelligently
                requests the indexer to perform grouping and aggregation in addition to range scan.
                The Indexer has been enhanced to perform grouping, COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(),
                AVG(), and related operations.</p>
            <p>This requires no changes to the user query, but a good index design to cover the
                query and order the keys is required. Not every query will benefit from this
                optimization, and not every index can accelerate every grouping and aggregation.
                Understanding the right patterns will help you to design your indexes and queries.
                Aggregate Pushdown to the global secondary index is supported on both storage
                engines: Standard GSI and Memory Optimized GSI (MOI).</p>
            <p>This reduction step of performing the GROUP BY and Aggregation on the indexer reduces
                the amount of data transfer and disk I/O, resulting in:<ul id="ul_cnz_fdq_xcb">
                    <li>Improved query response time</li>
                    <li>Improved resource utilization</li>
                    <li>Low latency</li>
                    <li>High scalability</li>
                    <li>Low TCO</li>
                </ul>For example, let's compare the previous vs. current performance of using GROUP
                BY and examine the EXPLAIN plan of the following query that is defined in the
                Couchbase <codeph>travel-sample</codeph>
                index:<codeblock>CREATE INDEX `def_type` ON `travel-sample`(`type`) </codeblock>Consider
                the
                query:<codeblock id="codeblocktst">SELECT type, COUNT(type)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY type;</codeblock>Before
                Couchbase version 5.5, this query engine fetched relevant data from the indexer and
                group the data within the query engine and then aggregate. This simple query takes
                about 250 ms.</p>
            <p><image href="images/GBAP_Ex0_QP_before55.png" id="image_lnh_v4q_xcb"/></p>
            <p>Now, in Couchbase version 5.5, this query use the same <codeph>def_type</codeph>
                index, but executes in under 70 ms. In the explain below, you can see fewer steps
                and the lack of the grouping step after the index scan because the index scan step
                does the grouping and aggregation as well.</p>

                /></p>
            <p>As the data and query complexity grows, the performance benefit (both latency and
                throughput) will grow as well.</p>
            <p>For example, consider the
                query:<codeblock>SELECT type, COUNT(type)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY type;</codeblock></p>

            <p>One of the common cases is to have both predicates and GROUP BY on leading keys of

                then think about the order of the keys.</p>
            <p>The query requires a predicate on leading keys to consider an index. The simplest

  <title>Install Sample Buckets</title><shortdesc>The <uicontrol>Sample Buckets</uicontrol> tab allows you to install the sample bucket
    data if it has not already been loaded in the system. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <note type="important">Remove the default bucket and sample buckets in production. Both types of
      buckets are created without a password protection and if permissions to such buckets are later
      assigned to users they will become "orphaned" in case these buckets are deleted.</note> 
  
    
    <p>Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can install sample buckets.</p>
    <p>The sample buckets are located in the Couchbase installation directory as .zip files as well.
      On Linux, the default location would be <filepath>/opt/couchbase/samples</filepath>. The
      sample bucket Zip files can be loaded into the cluster by using the <xref
        href="../cli/cbdocloader-tool.dita#cbdocloader_tool">cbdocloader </xref>tool. Example:
      <codeblock>/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -n localhost:8091 -u Admin -p Pass -b mybucket -s 100 /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip </codeblock></p>

    <p>To enable the update notifications using the Web Console: </p>
    <ol id="ol_uk4_cjw_zy">
      <li>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console</uicontrol> > <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> >
        select the <uicontrol>Sample Buckets</uicontrol> tab. </li>
      <li>Select the sample buckets that you want to load using the check boxes and click
          <uicontrol>Load Sample Data</uicontrol>. <p>If the sample bucket data has already been
          loaded, it is listed under the <wintitle>Installed Samples</wintitle> section of the page.

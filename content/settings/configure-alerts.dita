    Email Alerts
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Email alerts can be dispatched automatically when a significant error occurs.
  </shortdesc>
  
  <body>
    
    <p>
      Only Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can configure alerts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The email-alert system works by sending an email directly to a configured SMTP server. Each
      alert email is sent to the configured list of email recipients, to highlight specific issues
      and problems. Alerts are  provided as a popup within Couchbase Web Console. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is important to ensure that all Couchbase Server nodes have network access to the configured SMTP server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can define the settings using Couchbase Web Console, or using the <xref
        href="../rest-api/rest-cluster-email-notifications.dita#rest-cluster-alerts">REST
        API</xref>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <b>Email Alerts</b> screen appears as follows:

        width="720"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To set up email alerts using Couchbase Web Console, first, select the <uicontrol>Enable email alerts </uicontrol>check box, to enable the email-alerts
      configuration. Then, enter appropriate data into the fields listed below.

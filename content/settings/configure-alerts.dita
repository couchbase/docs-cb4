  <title>Alerts</title><shortdesc>Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can configure alerts, which raise email
    alerts when a significant error occurs on the Couchbase Server cluster.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <p>The email alert system works by sending an email directly to a configured SMTP server. Each alert email is sent to the list of configured email recipients to highlight specific issues and problems that you should be aware of and may need to check to ensure the health of your Couchbase cluster. Alerts are also provided as a popup within the Couchbase Web Console.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to ensure that all Couchbase Server nodes have network access to the configured SMTP server.

    <p>Select the <uicontrol>Enable email alerts </uicontrol>check box to enable the configuration
      of email alerts. These alerts are raised for the errors that you select in the <b>Available
        Alerts</b> section.</p>
    <p> It is also possible to configure Email alerts using the <xref

  <title>Configure Email Alerts</title><shortdesc>When alerts are configured, which raise email alerts when a significant error occurs on
    the Couchbase Server cluster.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <p>Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can configure alerts.</p>
    <p>The email alert system works by sending an email directly to a configured SMTP server. Each
      alert email is sent to the list of configured email recipients to highlight specific issues
      and problems that you should be aware of and may need to check to ensure the health of your
      Couchbase cluster. Alerts are also provided as a popup within the Couchbase Web Console. </p>
    <p>It is important to ensure that all Couchbase Server nodes have network access to the configured SMTP server.
    </p>
    <p>You can define the settings using the Web Console or using the <xref
        href="../rest-api/rest-cluster-email-notifications.dita#rest-cluster-alerts">REST
        API</xref>.</p>

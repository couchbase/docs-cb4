        executing queries against Couchbase Server.  Analytics contains a special version of cbq
        that works with the analytics service and can execute multi-line statements. Make sure you
        use the version of cbq located in your Analytics install folder.</p><p>If youâ€™re running
        Analytics on Docker, execute cbq using the following command:</p><p><cmdname>docker exec -it
          analytics cbq</cmdname></p>The cbq tool enables you to run N1QL queries from the command
        line.<p>The base syntax is: </p><p>
        <codeblock>cbq> create primary index on 'beer-sample';
cbq> select * from 'beer-sample' limit 1;</codeblock>

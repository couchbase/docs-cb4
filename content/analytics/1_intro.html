<p>This document is intended as a reference guide to the full syntax and semantics
of the SQL++ Query Language, a SQL-inspired language for working with
semistructured data. SQL++ has much in common with SQL, but there are also
differences due to the data model that the language is designed to serve. (SQL
was designed in the 1970â€™s for interacting with the flat, schema-ified world of
relational databases, while SQL++ is designed for the nested,
schema-less/schema-optional world of modern NoSQL systems.) In particular,
SQL++ in the context of Couchbase Analytics is intended for working with the JSON data model.</p>

<p>In what follows, we detail the features of the SQL++ language in a
grammar-guided manner: we list and briefly explain each of the productions in
the SQL++ grammar, offering examples (and results) for clarity.</p>

<p>SQL++ offers the following key advancements beyond N1QL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WITH:  SQL++ supports the ANSI SQL WITH clause to allow the definition of inlined views or variables of primitive types to simplify complex query construction;</li>
  <li>JOIN:  SQL++ supports the ANSI join syntax and allows joins on any condition expressions over datasets, arrays, or subqueries;</li>
  <li>GROUP BY: In SQL++, in addition to a set of aggregate functions as in standard SQL, the groups created by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GROUP BY</code> clause are directly usable in nested queries and/or to obtain nested results;</li>
  <li>Subquery: Any valid SQL++ query can be used as a subquery.</li>
</ul>

<p>For N1QL users, the following matrix is a quick N1QL compatibility cheat sheet for SQL++.</p>

<p>SQL++ generalizes N1QL's syntax constructs such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">USE KEYS</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON KEYS</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON KEY</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">NEST</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LEFT OUTER NEST</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARRAY</code> and thus eliminates cases where must-be-indexed or must-use-keys
restrictions are required for certain N1QL queries or expressions to be acceptable.
In addition, the general composability of SQL++ queries eliminates the need for some of N1QL's
special syntax; for example, SQL++ does not require or support the IN/WITHIN subclauses of
N1QL's existential (SOME, ANY, or EVERY) expressions.
Note that INSERT/UPSERT/DELETE are not supported at all in the Couchbase Analytics Service.
Data is mutated in Couchbase Server, using the Couchbase Server SDK or N1QL mutation, and
the mutations will then be automatically synchronized into the Couchbase Analytics Service.</p>

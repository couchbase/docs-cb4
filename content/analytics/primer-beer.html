        <h2 id="welcome-to-the-cbas-dp">Welcome to the CBAS DP!</h2>
<p>This document introduces the main features of the new Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS, pronounced like “seabass”) by example.
Since few things in life are more important than choosing the right beer to pair with one’s main dish,
this example explores the pairing of seabass and beers.
More specifically, it shows how to create a set of CBAS shadow datasets based on the Couchbase beer-sample bucket,
together with a set of illustrative queries, as a quick way to introduce you to the new “CBAS user experience”.
The complete set of steps to create and connect the sample datasets, along with a collection of runnable SQL++
queries and their expected results, are included.</p>

<p>This document assumes that you are comfortable using Couchbase Server and know how to query it using N1QL.
It assumes that you already have a running instance of Couchbase Server 4.5 or later on your favorite machine
and that you know how to interact with it using the Couchbase Console.
It also assumes that you have the Couchbase beer-sample example data bucket installed on that system.
Finally, this document assumes that you have already downloaded and successfully installed the CBAS DP
and that you have verified that it is up and running (e.g., by issuing a simple SQL++ test query like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Let there be beer!";
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you read through this document, you should try each step for yourself on your own CBAS instance.
You can use whatever your favorite CBAS interface is to do this (e.g., cbq or curl);
Once you have reached the end of this tutorial, you will be armed and dangerous,
having all the basic CBAS knowledge that you’ll need to start down the path of exploring the power of NoSQL data analytics.
As you have already heard by now, this will hopefully prove to be a freeing experience:
CBAS SQL++ queries never touch your Couchbase data servers, running instead (in parallel) on real-time shadow copies of your data.
As a result, you will find yourself in a world where you can “ask the system anything!” – you won’t need to worry about
slowing down the front-end machines with complex queries, you won’t have to create covering indexes to ask queries,
and the CBAS query language (SQL++) won’t try to keep you from asking queries that would be too perforamance-costly
to ask against your front-end data.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-of-data-in-cbas">The World of Data in CBAS</h2>
<p>In this section you will learn about the CBAS world model for data.</p>

<h3 id="organizing-data-in-cbas">Organizing Data in CBAS</h3>

<p>The top-level organizing concept in the CBAS data world is the <em>dataverse</em>.
A dataverse—short for “data universe”—is a place (similar to a database or a schema in a relational DBMS)
in which to create and manage data types, datasets, and other artifacts for a given CBAS application.
In the CBAS DP, all of the data types that you might need come pre-installed, and the kind of datasets
that you will create are called “shadow datasets”.
These datasets are containers – collections of JSON objects – that contain real-time shadow copies of selected front-end data.
When you start using a CBAS instance for the first time, it starts out “empty”;
it contains no data other than the CBAS system catalogs (which live in a special dataverse called the “Metadata” dataverse).
To store your data in CBAS, you can create a dataverse and then use it to hold the <em>datasets</em> for your own data.
However, you also get a “default” dataverse for free, and CBAS will just use that if you don’t create a new one.
Let’s put these concepts to work.</p>

<p>Our sample scenario here involves information about beers and their breweries.
We’ll use the “Default” dataverse, to keep things simple, so our first task is to tell CBAS about
the Couchbase Server data that we want to shadow and the shadow datasets where we want it to live.
The following CBAS DDL statements show how we can tell CBAS about the “beer-sample” bucket in Couchbase Server,
where all of the beer and brewery information resides, and ask CBAS to shadow the data using two datasets, breweries and beers.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE BUCKET beerBucket WITH {"name":"beer-sample","nodes":"127.0.0.1"};
CREATE SHADOW DATASET breweries ON beerBucket WHERE `type` = "brewery";
CREATE SHADOW DATASET beers ON beerBucket WHERE `type` = "beer";
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first statement (<em>CREATE BUCKET</em>) gives CBAS the information needed to access the data of interest from Couchbase Server.
The next two statements (<em>CREATE SHADOW DATASET</em>) create the target datasets in CBAS for the information of interest.
Notice how <em>WHERE</em> clauses are utilized to direct beer-related data into separate, type-specific datasets for easier querying.
Each of these datasets will be hash-partitioned (sharded) across all of the nodes running instances of the CBAS service.
To initiate the shadowing relationship of these datasets to the front-end data, one more step is needed, namely:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONNECT BUCKET beerBucket WITH {"password":""};
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once you have run this statement, CBAS will begin making its copy of the front-end data and continuously monitor it for changes.</p>

<h3 id="whats-lurking-in-the-shadows">What’s Lurking in the Shadows?</h3>

<p>The next thing you will probably want to do is to verify that your shadow datasets are really there and being populated.
The following SQL++ <em>SELECT</em> statements are one good way to accomplish that:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE ds FROM Metadata.`Dataset` ds WHERE ds.DataverseName = "Default";

SELECT VALUE COUNT(*) FROM breweries;
SELECT * FROM breweries ORDER BY name LIMIT 1;

SELECT VALUE COUNT(*) FROM beers;
SELECT * FROM beers ORDER BY name LIMIT 1;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first statement above looks in the CBAS system catalogs for datasets that have been created in the “Default” dataverse.
At this point, assuming that you are just getting started, you will see only your two new shadow datasets:</p>

<h2 id="sql-querying-your-cbas-data">SQL++: Querying Your CBAS Data</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You now have your Couchbase Server beer-related data being shadowed in CBAS.
You can start running ad hoc queries against your breweries and beers datasets.</p>

<p>The query language that CBAS supports is called SQL++, and it is a
SQL-inspired language designed for working with semistructured data.
SQL++ has much in common with SQL, but there are differences due to the data model that SQL++ is designed to serve.
SQL was designed in the 1970’s to interact with the flat, schema-ified world of relational databases.
SQL++ is designed for the nested, schema-less (or schema-optional, in CBAS) world of NoSQL systems.
SQL++ offers a mostly familar paradigm for experienced SQL users to use to query and manipulate data in CBAS.
SQL++ is also related to N1QL, the current query language in Couchbase Server.
SQL++ is really a functional superset of N1QL that is a bit closer to SQL,
and the differences between N1QL and SQL++ will eventually disappear (i.e., SQL++ is really the future of N1QL).</p>

<p>In this section we introduce SQL++ via a set of example queries, along with their expected results,
based on the data above, to help you get started.
Many of the most important features of SQL++ are presented in this set of representative queries.
You can find more details in the document on the <a href="datamodel.html">Data Model</a> of CBAS,
in the CBAS <a href="manual-sqlpp.html">SQL++ Reference Manual</a>,
and a complete list of the built-in functions is available in the <a href="functions-sqlpp.html">SQL++ Functions</a> document.</p>

<p>SQL++ is a highly composable expression language.
Even the very simple expression “1+1;” is a valid SQL++ query that evaluates to 2.
(Try it for yourself!)
But enough talk!
Let’s go ahead and try writing some queries and see about learning SQL++ by example.</p>

<h3 id="query-0---key-based-lookup">Query 0 - Key-Based Lookup</h3>
<p>For our first query, let’s find a particular brewery based on its Couchbase Server key.
We can do this for the Kona Brewing company as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT meta(bw) AS meta, bw AS data
FROM breweries bw
WHERE meta(bw).id = 'kona_brewing';
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As in SQL, the query’s <em>FROM</em> clause  binds the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">bw</code> incrementally to the data instances residing in
the dataset named breweries.
Its <em>WHERE</em> clause  selects only those bindings having the primary key of interest;
the key is accessed (as in N1QL) by using the <em>meta</em> function to get to the meta-information about the records.
The <em>SELECT</em> returns all of the meta-information plus the data value (the selected brewery record in this case)
for each binding that satisfies the predicate.</p>

<p>The expected result for this query is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "data": {
        "geo": {
            "accuracy": "RANGE_INTERPOLATED",
            "lon": -155.996,
            "lat": 19.642
        },
        "country": "United States",
        "website": "http:\/\/www.konabrewingco.com",
        "code": "96740",
        "address": [
            "75-5629 Kuakini Highway"
        ],
        "city": "Kailua-Kona",
        "phone": "1-808-334-1133",
        "name": "Kona Brewing",
        "description": "",
        "state": "Hawaii",
        "type": "brewery",
        "updated": "2010-07-22 20:00:20"
    },
    "meta": {
        "vbid": 30,
        "cas": 569488800022528,
        "flags": 50331648,
        "id": "kona_brewing",
        "seq": 56
    }
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice how the resulting record of interest has two fields whose names were requested in the <em>SELECT</em> clause.</p>

<h3 id="query-1---exact-match-lookup">Query 1 - Exact-Match Lookup</h3>
<p>SQL++, like SQL, supports a variety of different predicates.
For our next query, let’s find the same brewery information but in a slightly simpler/cleaner way based only on the data:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE bw
FROM breweries bw
WHERE bw.name = 'Kona Brewing';
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This query’s expected result is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "geo": {
        "accuracy": "RANGE_INTERPOLATED",
        "lon": -155.996,
        "lat": 19.642
    },
    "country": "United States",
    "website": "http:\/\/www.konabrewingco.com",
    "code": "96740",
    "address": [
        "75-5629 Kuakini Highway"
    ],
    "city": "Kailua-Kona",
    "phone": "1-808-334-1133",
    "name": "Kona Brewing",
    "description": "",
    "state": "Hawaii",
    "type": "brewery",
    "updated": "2010-07-22 20:00:20"
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In SQL++, you can select a single value (whether it be an atomic/scalar value or a record value
or an unordered or ordered collection value) by using a <em>SELECT VALUE</em> clause as was done above.
If you instead use the more SQL-familier <em>SELECT</em> clause, SQL++ will return records instead of values,
and since a given query may <em>SELECT</em> multiple values in its result (like our first query did),
you will get a slightly differently shaped result using <em>SELECT</em> instead of <em>SELECT VALUE</em>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "bw": {
        "geo": {
            "accuracy": "RANGE_INTERPOLATED",
            "lon": -155.996,
            "lat": 19.642

    }
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="query-2---other-query-filters">Query 2 - Other Query Filters</h3>
<p>SQL++ can apply ranges and other conditions on any data type that supports the appropriate set of comparators.
As an example, the next query applies a range condition together with a string condition to select breweries:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE bw
FROM breweries bw
WHERE bw.geo.lat &gt; 60.0
  AND bw.name LIKE '%Brewing%'
ORDER BY bw.name;

<h3 id="query-3-and-friends---equijoin">Query 3 (and friends) - Equijoin</h3>
<p>In addition to simply binding variables to data instances and returning them “whole”,
an SQL++ query can construct new records to return based on combinations of variable bindings.
This gives SQL++ the power to do projections and joins much like those done using multi-table <em>FROM</em> clauses in SQL.
For example, suppose we wanted a list of all breweries paired with their associated beers,
with the list enumerating the brewery name and the beer name for each such pair.
We could do this as follows in SQL++ (which also limits the answer set size to at most 20 results):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT bw.name AS brewer, br.name AS beer
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 20;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The result of this query is a sequence of new records, one for each brewery/beer pair.
Each instance in the result will be a record containing two fields, “brewer” and “beer”,
containing the brewery’s name and the beer’s name, respectively, for each brewery/beer pair.
Notice how the use of a SQL-style <em>SELECT</em> clause, as opposed to the new SQL++ <em>SELECT VALUE</em>
clause, automatically results in the construction of a new record value for each result.</p>

<p>The expected result of this example SQL++ join query is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) ALT"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) Bruin"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) IPA"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) Pale"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) Pecan Porter"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) Whiskey Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "(512) Wit"
}, {
    "brewer": "(512) Brewing Company",
    "beer": "One"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "21A IPA"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "563 Stout"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Amendment Pale Ale"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Bitter American"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Double Trouble IPA"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "General Pippo's Porter"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "North Star Red"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Oyster Point Oyster Stout"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Potrero ESB"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "South Park Blonde"
}, {
    "brewer": "21st Amendment Brewery Cafe",
    "beer": "Watermelon Wheat"
}, {
    "brewer": "3 Fonteinen Brouwerij Ambachtelijke Geuzestekerij",
    "beer": "Drie Fonteinen Kriek"
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we were feeling lazy, e.g., while browsing our data casually, we might use <em>SELECT *</em> in SQL++ to
return all of the matching user/message data:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT *
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 20;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In SQL++, this <em>SELECT *</em> query will produce a new nested record for each user/message pair.
Each result record contains one field (named after the “breweries” variable) to hold the brewery record
and another field (named after the “beers” variable) to hold the matching beer record.
Note that the nested nature of this SQL++ <em>SELECT *</em> result is different than traditional SQL,
as SQL was not designed to handle the richer, nested data model that underlies the design of SQL++.</p>

<p>The expected result of this version of the SQL++ join query for our sample data set is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {

</div>

<p>Die-hard SQL <em>JOIN</em>-_ON_ clause syntax fans will be happy to know that SQL++ hasn’t forgotten them,
so a result identical to the one immediately above can also be produced as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT *
FROM breweries bw JOIN beers br ON br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 20;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally (for now :-)), another more explicit SQL++ way of achieving the very same result as above is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE {"bw": bw, "br": br}
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 20;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This version of the query uses an explicit record constructor to build each result record.
(It is worth noting that the string field names “bw” and “br” in the record constructor above are both simple SQL++
expressions themselves—so in the most general case, even the resulting field names can be computed as part of the query,
making SQL++ a very powerful tool for slicing and dicing semistructured data.)</p>

<p>(It is worth knowing, with respect to influencing CBAS’s query evaluation,
that <em>FROM</em> and <em>JOIN</em> clauses—<em>a.k.a.</em> joins— are currently evaluated in order,
with the “left” clause probing the data of the “right” clause.)</p>

<h3 id="query-4---nested-outer-join">Query 4 - Nested Outer Join</h3>
<p>In order to support joins between tables with missing/dangling join tuples, the designers of SQL ended
up shoe-horning a subset of the relational algebra into SQL’s <em>FROM</em> clause syntax—and providing a
variety of join types there for users to choose from (which SQL++ supports for SQL compatibility).
Left outer joins are particularly important in SQL, e.g., to print a summary of customers and orders,
grouped by customer, without omitting those customers who haven’t placed any orders yet.</p>

<p>The SQL++ language supports nesting, both of queries and of query results,
and the combination allows for a cleaner and more natural approach to such queries.
As an example, supposed we wanted, for each brewery, to produce a record that contains
the brewery name along with a list of all of the brewery’s offered beer names and alcohol percentages.
In the flat (a.k.a. 1NF) world of SQL, approximating this query would involve a left outer join between
breweries and beers, ordered by brewery, with the brewery name being repeated along side each beer’s information.
In the richer (“NoSQL”) world of SQL++, this use case can be handled more naturally as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT bw.name AS brewer,
      (SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
       WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id) AS beers
FROM breweries bw
ORDER BY bw.name
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This SQL++ query binds the variable “bw” to the records in breweries;
for each brewery, it constructs a result record containing a “brewer” field with the brewery’s name plus a “beers”
field with a nested collection of records containing the beer name and alcohol percentage for each of the brewery’s beers.
The nested collection field for each brewery is created using a correlated subquery.
(Note: While it looks like nested loops could be involved in computing the result,
CBAS recogizes the equivalence of such a query to an outerjoin, so it will use an
efficient parallel join strategy when actually computing the query’s result.)</p>

<p>Here is this example query’s expected output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {

<h3 id="query-5---theta-join">Query 5 - Theta Join</h3>
<p>Not all joins are expressible as equijoins and computable using equijoin-oriented algorithms.
The join predicates for some use cases involve predicates with functions; CBAS supports the

techniques (and broadcast joins in the parallel case).</p>

<p>As an example of such a use case, suppose that we wanted, for each Arizona brewery, to get
the brewery’s name, location, and a list of competitors’ names—where competitors are other
breweries that are geographically close to their location.
In SQL++, this can be accomplished in a manner similar to the previous query, but with locality plus
name inequality instead of a simple key equality condition in the correlated query’s <em>WHERE</em> clause:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT bw1.name AS brewer, bw1.geo AS location,

         AND abs(bw2.geo.lon - bw1.geo.lon) &lt;= 0.1

<h3 id="query-6---existential-quantification">Query 6 - Existential Quantification</h3>
<p>The expressive power of SQL++ includes support for queries involving “some” (existentially quantified)
and “all” (universally quantified) query semantics.
Quantified predicates are especially useful for querying datasets involving nested collections of records,
in order to find records where some or all of their nested sets’ records satisfy a condition of interest.
To illustrate their use in such situations, we’ll start here by using another (orthogonal) feature of SQL++,
its <em>WITH</em> clause, to create a temporarily nested view of breweries and their beers; we will then use an
existential (<em>SOME</em>) predicate to find those breweries whose beers include at least one IPA and return the
brewery’s name, phone number, and complete list of beer names and associated alcohol levels.
(This is clearly an important analytical use case, right?!)
Here is the resulting SQL++ query:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>WITH nested_breweries AS
     (
      SELECT bw.name AS brewer, bw.phone,
            (
             SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
             WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
             ORDER BY br.name
            ) AS beers
      FROM breweries bw
     )
SELECT VALUE nb FROM nested_breweries nb
WHERE (SOME b IN nb.beers SATISFIES b.name LIKE '%IPA%')
ORDER BY nb.brewer
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The expected result in this case is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {

<h3 id="query-7---universal-quantification">Query 7 - Universal Quantification</h3>
<p>As an example of a universally quantified SQL++ query, we can find those breweries that only have IPAs:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>WITH nested_breweries AS
     (
       SELECT bw.name AS brewer, bw.phone,
            (
             SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
             WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
            ) AS beers
      FROM breweries bw
     )
SELECT VALUE nb FROM nested_breweries nb
WHERE (EVERY b IN nb.beers SATISFIES b.name LIKE '%IPA%')
ORDER BY nb.brewer
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The expected result in this case is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "phone": "",
    "beers": [

} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="query-8---simple-aggregation">Query 8 - Simple Aggregation</h3>
<p>Like SQL, the SQL++ language of CBAS provides support for computing aggregates over large amounts of data.
As a very simple example, the following SQL++ query computes the total number of beers in a SQL-like way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_beers FROM beers;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This query’s result will be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">"num_beers"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5891</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>If an “unwrapped” value is preferred, the following variant could be used instead:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE COUNT(b) FROM beers b;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This time the result will simply be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>5891
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In SQL++, aggregate functions can be applied to arbitrary collections, including subquery results.
To illustrate, here is a less SQL-like—and also more explicit—way to express the query above:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT VALUE ARRAY_COUNT((SELECT b FROM beers b));
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For each traditional SQL aggregate function <em>F</em>, SQL++ has a corresponding function <em>ARRAY_F</em> that
can be used to perform the desired aggregate calculation.
Each such function is a regular function that takes a collection-valued argument to aggregate over.
Thus, the query above counts the results produced by the beer selection subquery, and the previous,
more SQL-like versions are just syntactic sugar for SQL++ queries that logically use <em>ARRAY_COUNT</em>.
(Note: Subqueries in SQL++ must always be parenthesized.)</p>

<h3 id="query-9-and-friends---grouping-and-aggregation">Query 9 (and friends) - Grouping and Aggregation</h3>
<p>Also like SQL, SQL++ supports grouped aggregation.
For each brewery that offers more than 30 beers,
the following group-by/aggregate query reports the number of beers that it offers.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT br.brewery_id, COUNT(*) AS num_beers
FROM beers br
GROUP BY br.brewery_id
HAVING num_beers &gt; 30
ORDER BY num_beers DESC;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <em>FROM</em> clause incrementally binds the variable <em>br</em> to beers, and the <em>GROUP BY</em> clause groups
the beers by their associated brewery id.
Unlike SQL, where data is tabular—flat—the data model underlying SQL++ allows for nesting.
Thus, due to the <em>GROUP BY</em> clause, the <em>SELECT</em> clause in this query sees a sequence of <em>br</em> groups,
with each such group having an associated <em>brewery_id</em> variable value (i.e., the producing brewery’s id).
In the context of the <em>SELECT</em> clause, <em>brewery_id</em> is bound to the brewery’s id and <em>br</em>
is now re-bound (due to grouping) to the <em>set</em> of beers issued by that brewery.
The <em>SELECT</em> clause yields a result record containing the brewery’s id and the count of the items
in the associated beer set.
The query result will contain one such record per brewery id.</p>

<p>Here is the expected result for this query over the sample data:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "num_beers": 57,
    "brewery_id": "midnight_sun_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 49,
    "brewery_id": "rogue_ales"
}, {
    "num_beers": 38,
    "brewery_id": "anheuser_busch"
}, {
    "num_beers": 37,
    "brewery_id": "egan_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 37,
    "brewery_id": "troegs_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 36,
    "brewery_id": "boston_beer_company"
}, {
    "num_beers": 34,
    "brewery_id": "titletown_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 34,
    "brewery_id": "f_x_matt_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 33,
    "brewery_id": "sierra_nevada_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 32,
    "brewery_id": "stone_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 31,
    "brewery_id": "southern_tier_brewing_co"
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>CBAS has multiple evaluation strategies available for processing grouped aggregate queries.
For grouped aggregation, the system knows how to employ both sort-based and hash-based aggregation methods,
with sort-based methods being used by default and a hint being available to suggest that a different approach
(hashing) be used in processing a particular SQL++ query.</p>

<p>The following query is nearly identical to the previous one, but adds a hash-based aggregation hint:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT br.brewery_id, COUNT(*) AS num_beers
FROM beers br
/*+ hash */
GROUP BY br.brewery_id
HAVING num_beers &gt; 30
ORDER BY num_beers DESC;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here is the expected result (the same result, but in a slightly different order):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "num_beers": 57,
    "brewery_id": "midnight_sun_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 49,
    "brewery_id": "rogue_ales"
}, {
    "num_beers": 38,
    "brewery_id": "anheuser_busch"
}, {
    "num_beers": 37,
    "brewery_id": "egan_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 37,
    "brewery_id": "troegs_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 36,
    "brewery_id": "boston_beer_company"
}, {
    "num_beers": 34,
    "brewery_id": "titletown_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 34,
    "brewery_id": "f_x_matt_brewing"
}, {
    "num_beers": 33,
    "brewery_id": "sierra_nevada_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 32,
    "brewery_id": "stone_brewing_co"
}, {
    "num_beers": 31,
    "brewery_id": "southern_tier_brewing_co"
} ]
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="query-10---grouping-and-limits">Query 10 - Grouping and Limits</h3>
<p>In some use cases it is not necessary to compute the entire answer to a query.
In some cases, just having the first <em>N</em> or top <em>N</em> results is sufficient.
This is expressible in SQL++ using the <em>LIMIT</em> clause combined with the <em>ORDER BY</em> clause.
(You may have noticed that we have been using the <em>LIMIT</em> clause all along to keep the
result set sizes in this document manageable. :-))</p>

<p>The following SQL++ query returns the top three breweries based on their numbers of offered beers.
It also illustrates the use of multiple aggregate functions to compute various alcohol content statistics
for their beers as well as the use of a join to identify the breweries by name rather than by id:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT bw.name,
       COUNT(*) AS num_beers,
       AVG(br.abv) AS abv_avg,
       MIN(br.abv) AS abv_min,
       MAX(br.abv) AS abv_max
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
GROUP BY bw.name
ORDER BY num_beers DESC
LIMIT 3;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The expected result for this query is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {
    "num_beers": 57,
    "name": "Midnight Sun Brewing Co.",
    "abv_max": 16.0,

<h3 id="everything-must-change">Everything Must Change</h3>
<p>So far we have been walking through the SQL++ query capabilities of CBAS.
What really makes CBAS interesting, however, is that it brings this query power to bear on your nearly-current Couchbase Server
data, enabling you to harness the power of parallelism in CBAS to analyze what’s going on with your data “up front” in essentially
real time—without perturbing your front-end applications’ performance (or the resulting front-end user experience).
Before closing this tutorial, then, let’s take a very quick look at that aspect of CBAS.</p>

<p>To start, the following SQL++ query lists all of the Kona Brewery’s current beer offerings:</p>

WHERE b.brewery_id = "kona_brewing"
ORDER BY meta(b).id;
</code></pre>

<p>To illustrate CBAS in action, suppose that Kona’s marketing department determines that a light beer is needed.
You can use your favorite Couchbase Server interface to modify the front-end server’s beer-sample content accordingly, e.g.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>INSERT INTO `beer-sample` ( KEY, VALUE )
  VALUES
  (
    "kona_brewing-skimboard_light_ale",
    {"name": "Skimboard Light Ale", "abv": 4.0, "ibu": 0.0, "srm": 0.0, "upc": 0, "type": "beer", "brewery_id": "kona_brewing", "updated": "2010-07-22 20:00:20", "description": "", "style": "Light Beer", "category": "North American Ale"}
  )
RETURNING META().id as docid, *;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>CBAS will shadow this change, updating the beers shadow dataset as a result.
Go ahead and rerun the CBAS SQL++ query that lists the Kona Brewery’s beer offerings:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT meta(b).id, b as beer FROM beers b
WHERE b.brewery_id = "kona_brewing"
ORDER BY meta(b).id;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The result of the query now reflects the new beer offering:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ {

<p>To further illustrate CBAS in action, suppose that Kona’s CEO determines that a light beer is in fact NOT needed.
You can use your favorite N1QL interface again to modify the Couchbase Server’s beer-sample content accordingly, i.e.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>DELETE FROM `beer-sample` b USE KEYS "kona_brewing-skimboard_light_ale";
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, if you run the SQL++ Kona beer list query on CBAS once again, you will find that the Kona CEO’s wishes have been
shadowed in CBAS as well.</p>

<h2 id="further-help">Further Help</h2>
<p>That’s it! You are now armed and dangerous with respect to semistructured data management using CBAS via SQL++.
More information about SQL++ is available in the SQL++ Query Language (SQL++) reference document as well as in
its companion SQL++ Functions document.</p>

<p>CBAS is a powerful new NoSQL analytics capbability; we hope that you’ll find it useful in exploring and analyzing your
Couchbase Server data without having to worry about front-end impact or doing ETL stunts to make your analyses possible.
Use it wisely, and remember: “With great power comes great responsibility…” :-)
Do let us know how you like it…!</p>

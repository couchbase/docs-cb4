   <section><title>Create a New Bucket using the Couchbase Web Console</title>Go to <menucascade>

      </menucascade>. <p>A dialog containing the configuration for your new bucket appears. Remember
        that when you create a new bucket and save the configuration, the node status indicator will
        be yellow until all of the vBuckets are created across the cluster. Once this is finished,
        the indicator turns green. </p></section>

      <title>Bucket Settings</title>
      <p>The bucket name can only contain characters in range A-Z, a-z, 0-9 as well as underscore,
        period, dash and percent and can be a maximum of 100 characters in length. </p>
      <p>There are two bucket types: Couchbase buckets and Memcached buckets. In most circumstances
        choose a Couchbase bucket, even if all you are using Couchbase Server only as a Highly
        Available Cache system. </p>
      <p>If you need the memcached-like functionality, it is recommended that you use Couchbase’s
        memcached proxy Moxi. The memcached buckets are available to provide administration
        capabilities for regular memcached and backward compatibility and offer none of the high-end
        features Couchbase Server is known for. For more specific information, see <xref
          href="../architecture/core-data-access-buckets.dita#concept_qqk_4r2_xs"/>.</p>

      <title>Memory Size</title>
      <p>In the <wintitle>Memory Size</wintitle> section, you will configure the RAM quota your
        bucket will allocate on a per node basis. The value you enter must fit with the overall
        cluster RAM quota. The cluster quota and what you are trying to add are displayed in the bar
        on the <wintitle>Setting</wintitle> page. The bucket RAM quota can be dynamically altered up
        or down with zero downtime to the cluster at any point in the future, provided you have
        enough cluster resources.</p>
      <p>Regarding Cache Metadata, keep in mind that it can have serious implications on your
        application’s performance. </p>
      <p>Use <term>Value ejection</term> unless you know very well what <term>Full ejection</term>
        does, why you should use it and what impacts it can have on your application and the
        operation of your database. If you use Full ejection effectively, it is very powerful and
        expands what you can do with Couchbase Server. If you use it incorrectly, it can cause
        performance problems in your application and operation of your database. Please make sure
        you read the detailed documentation on <xref
          href="../architecture/db-engine-architecture.dita#concept_b5n_bwn_vs/full-ejection"/>
        before changing this setting. </p>

    <section id="bucket-creation-conflict-resolution">
      <title>Conflict Resolution</title>
      <p>The conflict resolution strategy is set on a per bucket basis. It is chosen during bucket
        creation and cannot be changed. The default conflict resolution setting is 'Sequence
        number'.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about the two different conflict resolution strategies in <xref href="../xdcr/xdcr-conflict-resolution.dita"/>.</p>
      <p>You can also
        set the conflict resolution method using the CLI <xref
          href="../cli/cbcli/bucket-create.dita#reference_llp_znv_sq"/> command, or the <xref
          href="../rest-api/rest-bucket-create.dita#rest-bucket-create">REST API</xref>..</p>

    <section>
      <title>Replicas</title>
      <p>One replica is configured by default, even if your cluster does not yet have enough nodes
        to support replicas (minimum two nodes). </p>
      <p>The general rule is to have a replica for each node that can fail in the cluster. Best
        practice is to keep at least one replica copy configured at all times and most users run
        with one replica. If you decide that more replica copies are needed for your bucket, make
        sure that you read the <xref href="../install/sizing-general.dita#topic_axp_glg_xs"
          >sizing</xref> section of Couchbase Server documentation. The more replicas you have, the
        more server and network resources are required. </p>
      <p>In general, you will have one replica for clusters up to 5 data nodes, one or two replicas
        in clusters from 5 to 10 data nodes and three replicas only in clusters with 10 or more data
        nodes. </p>

      <title>Disk I/O Optimization</title>
      <p>The Disk I/O setting control the disk I/O priority the bucket will get. The setting
        defaults to low priority, because if all buckets in a cluster are set to the same priority,
        then all buckets get the same disk I/O. </p>
      <p>This setting only enables prioritization if at least one bucket in the cluster is set
        differently. Therefore, there is no effect if all buckets are set to high priority. If
        buckets with different priorities exist in the cluster, there are internal server resources
        allocated for high and low priority buckets. </p>

          width="570"/></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Auto-Compaction</title>
      <p>This setting allows you to override the cluster-wide auto-compaction settings for the
        specified bucket. </p>
      <p>For the most part, you should never need to use this setting. </p>
      <p><image href="../admin/picts/bucket-auto-compact.png" id="image_bkg_wfs_zs" align="left"
          width="570"/></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Flush</title>
      <p>This setting enables or disables the <codeph>flush</codeph> operation for the bucket and is
        disabled (unchecked) by default. Checking this option does not directly trigger the
          <codeph>flush</codeph>, it only allows a <codeph>flush</codeph> to be triggered.</p>
      <p>It is recommended that the <codeph>flush</codeph> capability is disabled in production as
        it irreversibly deletes every document in the bucket. Even for use cases where this is the
        desired behaviour, flushing is not recommended as it is a very disruptive process.</p>
      <p><image href="../admin/picts/bucket-flush.png" id="image_b5v_pfs_zs" align="left"
          width="250"/></p>
      <p>You can flush a bucket <xref href="bucket-flush.dita">using the UI</xref> or using the CLI command <xref
          href="../cli/cbcli/bucket-flush.dita#cbcli-bucket-flush">bucket-flush</xref> and REST API
          <xref href="../rest-api/rest-bucket-flush.dita#rest-bucket-flush"
          >rest-bucket-flush.</xref>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Bucket Creation Status Update</title>
      <p>After the bucket creation is completed, you can get the status update as follows: <ul>
        <li>Send a GET or any other command to the memcached on the created bucket. If you receive
          the response <codeph>ETMPFAIL</codeph>, try the command later.</li>
        <li>Monitor the ep-engine bucket stats on one of the nodes. The bucket is created when the
          stat <codeph>ep_degraded_mode</codeph> changes from <codeph>true</codeph> to
          <codeph>false</codeph>.</li>
        <li>Monitor <filepath>/pools/default/buckets/&lt;bucketname&gt;</filepath> or
          <filepath>/pools/default/bucketsStreaming/&lt;bucketname&gt;</filepath>. The bucket is
          created when all node statuses turn from <codeph>warmup</codeph> to
          <codeph>healthy</codeph>.</li>
      </ul></p>
      
    </section>
    <section><title>Create a New Bucket with CLI or REST API</title>
      <p>You can also use the Couchbase Server CLI command <xref
        href="../cli/cbcli/bucket-create.dita#reference_llp_znv_sq">bucket-create</xref> or REST
        API command <xref href="../rest-api/rest-bucket-create.dita#rest-bucket-create"
          >rest-bucket-create</xref>.</p>

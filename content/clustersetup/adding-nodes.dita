  <title>Adding a server</title><shortdesc>Add nodes to a cluster via the UI, CLI, or REST API interface.</shortdesc>

  <body>
    <p>There are several methods for adding a node to a cluster. In each case, one or more nodes
      are marked to be added to the cluster, but it doesn't become an active member of the cluster
      until you rebalance the cluster. </p>
    <p>In a CLI call, the rebalance can optionally be done while adding the new nodes. When using
      the UI, rebalancing requires an extra click. </p>

      
      <p>When setting up a new Couchbase Server installation, 
        you have the option to join the new node to an existing cluster.</p>
      <p>During the first step, select the <uicontrol>Join a cluster now</uicontrol>
        radio button, as shown in the figure below:</p>

    </p>
    <p>You are prompted to add the following information: <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>IP Address</dt>
          <dd>The IP address or hostname of an existing node within the cluster you want to
            join.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl><dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Username</dt>
          <dd>The username of the administrator of the target cluster.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl><dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Password</dt>
          <dd>The password of the administrator of the target cluster.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl></p>
   
      
      <p>The node will be created as a new cluster, but the pending status of the node within the new
        cluster will be indicated on the <wintitle>Cluster Overview</wintitle> page, as shown in the example
        below:</p>

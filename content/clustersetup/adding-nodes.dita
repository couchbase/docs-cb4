  <title>Adding a Node</title><shortdesc>Add a node to the cluster during initial installation or after the installation. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can use the UI, CLI, or REST API interface to
      add a node.</p>
    <p>There are several methods for adding a node to a cluster. In each case, one or more nodes are
      marked to be added to the cluster, but it doesn't become an active member of the cluster until
      you rebalance the cluster. </p>
    <p>In a CLI call, the rebalance can optionally be done while adding the new node and using the
      UI, rebalancing requires an extra step. </p>
    
    <section><title>During Initial Installation</title>
      
      
      
    </section>
      
      <p>When setting up a new Couchbase Server installation, you have the option to join the new
      node to an existing cluster. For detailed instructions, see <xref
        href="../install/init-setup.dita#topic12527"/>.</p>
   
      
      <p>The node will be created as a new cluster, but the pending status of the node within the
      new cluster will be indicated, as shown in the example below:</p>

    <section>
      <title>Using the UI</title>
      
      <p>Using the same method, you can add a server that was previously part of this or another
        cluster. During this process, Couchbase Server must be running.</p>

      <p>A warning will appear indicating that the operation is destructive on the destination
        server. Any data currently stored on the server will be deleted, and if the server is
        currently part of another cluster, it will be removed and marked as failed over in that
        cluster.</p>
      <p>Once the information has been entered successfully, the node will be marked as ready to be
        added to the cluster, and the cluster's pending rebalance count will be updated.</p>
      <note type="important">Once a node is added with a specific service, you cannot change the
        type of services on that node. You must remove the node, rebalance, and then add it back to
        the cluster with the services of your choice.</note>

        <p>If you receive a failure message, you will be notified of the type of failure.
          You can add multiple nodes in one command by supplying 
          multiple <codeph>--server-add</codeph> command-line options to the command.
        </p>
        <note type="note">Once a node has been successfully added, the Couchbase Server cluster indicates that 
          a rebalance is required to complete the operation.
        </note>
      
      <p>Hereâ€™s an example of cluster rebalance after adding a new node: Request syntax with
          rebalancing:<codeblock>couchbase-cli rebalance
            -c [localhost]:8091
            --server-add=[host]:8091
            --server-add-username=[administrator]
            --server-add-password=[password]     </codeblock></p>
        <p>You
              can cancel the addition of a node to a cluster without having to perform a rebalance
              operation. Canceling the operation removes the server from the cluster without having
              transferred or exchanged any data, since no rebalance operation took place. You can cancel
              the operation using the Couchbase Web Console.</p>

  
  
  
  
    </section>  <section><title>Using the REST API</title>With the REST API, you can add nodes to the cluster by
      providing the IP address, administrator username, and password as part of the data
        payload.<p>Use the <cmdname>curl</cmdname> command to add a new node. If you are adding
        another service than data, which is the default, specify that service index or n1ql:
        <codeblock>&gt; curl -u cluster-username:cluster-password localhost:8091/controller/addNode\
          -d "hostname=192.168.0.68&amp;user=node-username&amp;password=node-password&amp;services=n1ql"</codeblock>

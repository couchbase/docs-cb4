  <title>Removing a Node</title>
  <shortdesc>You can remove any node from the Couchbase cluster. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can remove a node from the Couchbase
      cluster.</p>
      
    
    <p>If you remove a node that is running one of the services, it will have following results:<ul>
        <li>Data service - reduced capacity to handle key/value workload.</li>
        <li>Index service -  index data loss on that node. This service does not support rebalance.
          When a node running the index service is removed or failed over, indexes that reside on
          the node are not moved to another node after rebalancing. These indexes are no longer
          available for queries and are dropped.

    <p>Before you remove a node from the cluster, ensure that you have the capacity within the
      remaining nodes to handle the workload.  Removing a node does not stop the node from servicing
      requests. Instead, it only marks the node as ready for removal from the cluster. You must
      perform a rebalance operation to complete the removal process. Once a node is removed, it is
      no longer part of the cluster and can be switched off, updated, or upgraded.</p>

    <p>Prevent possible problems during online upgrades. Occasionally, during an online upgrade if
      all old nodes are removed from the cluster, clients may no longer know about any nodes and
      fail to connect. To prevent such problems, make sure that you provide one of the following
      solutions: <ul>
        <li>At least one of the original nodes is maintained in the cluster, and this node is listed
          in the client's server configuration.</li>
        <li>The client's server configuration is appropriately updated to include at least one new
          node before the last old node is removed.</li>
      </ul></p>

      cluster using the Web Console:  <ol>
        <li>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > Server</uicontrol> page, select a node that
          you want to remove and click <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li>After the node is removed, click <uicontrol>Rebalance</uicontrol> to rebalance the cluster.<p>

    <section><title>Using the CLI</title>
      <p>You cannot mark a node for removal from the command-line without simultaneously initiating a
      rebalance operation.
  </p>
  
        
        <p> The <cmdname>rebalance</cmdname> command accepts one or more <codeph>--server-add</codeph>
          or <codeph>--server-remove</codeph> options. This adds or removes the server from the cluster,
          and immediately initiates a rebalance operation.</p>
        
        <p>To remove a node during a rebalance operation:</p>
        
        <codeblock>&gt; couchbase-cli rebalance --cluster=127.0.0.1:8091 \
          --user Administrator --password Password \
          --server-remove=192.168.0.73</codeblock>
     
     
     
    </section>  <section><title>Using the REST API</title>
      <p> Remove a node from a cluster  with a <cmdname>curl</cmdname> command.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Curl request example:
        <codeblock>curl -u admin:password -d otpNode=ns_1@192.168.0.107 \
          http://192.168.0.106:8091/controller/ejectNode </codeblock></p>

  <title>Data Bucket Setup</title><shortdesc>Buckets are used to distribute data across the system.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <p>Couchbase Server creates a <term>default bucket</term> as part of the installation process.</p>
    <p>You can test the system using the default and sample buckets. However, since these buckets
      have no password protection you need to remove them in production. </p>
    <p>After installing and testing the system, create a new bucket named appropriately and with the
      specific configuration for your application and then remove the default and sample
      buckets.</p>

  <body>
    
    <p>Couchbase Server creates a <term>default bucket</term> as part of the installation process.</p>

    <p>While testing with this bucket is fine, it is recommended that you create a new 
      bucket named appropriately and with the specific configuration for your application and then remove the default bucket to save resources.</p>

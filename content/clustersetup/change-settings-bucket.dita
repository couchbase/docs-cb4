  <title>Change Bucket Settings</title><shortdesc>Full, Cluster and Bucket Administrators can edit bucket settings using the <uicontrol>Change Bucket
    Settings</uicontrol> option.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The settings in this dialog are all covered in more detail in <xref href="../clustersetup/create-bucket.dita">Create a New Bucket</xref>.</p>
    <p>After a bucket has been created, the following settings can be altered: <ul>
        <li><b>Per Node RAM Quota</b> - The amount of RAM allocated per-node to this bucket. If
          lowering this setting, the provided value can't be lower than the amount of memory
          currently used by the bucket on any of the nodes in your cluster. This setting takes
          effect immediately.</li>
        <li><b>Cache Ejection Policy</b> - The ejection policy used by a bucket, the two different
          policies are discussed in <xref
            href="../architecture/db-engine-architecture.dita#full-ejection">Tunable Memory with
            Ejection Policy</xref>. <note type="important">Changing the ejection policy will invoke
            a bucket restart, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms
            up.</note></li>
        <li><b>Access Control</b> - The authentication policy used by a bucket, if changing this
          setting you should ensure that all client applications are aware of the new authentication
          credentials.</li>
        <li><b>Number of Replicas</b> - The replication factor of a bucket can be changed at any
          time, although a rebalance will be required after changing this setting to redistribute
          the correct number of replica items across the cluster.</li>
        <li><b>Disk I/O Optimization</b> - The <xref
            href="../architecture/db-engine-architecture.dita#disk-priority">I/O workload
            priority</xref> of a bucket can be changed at any time after the bucket has been
            created.<note type="important">Changing the I/O priority will invoke a bucket restart,
            resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.</note></li>
        <li><b>Auto-compaction Parameters</b> - The auto-compaction settings to override the
          cluster-wide settings as discussed in <xref
            href="../settings/configure-compact-settings.dita">Auto-compaction Settings</xref>.</li>
        <li><b>Flush</b> - This setting enables or disables the <xref
            href="../clustersetup/bucket-flush.dita">Flush</xref> command for this bucket, this can
          be changed at any time.</li>
      </ul> There are some settings that cannot be changed after bucket creation: <ul>
        <li><b>Bucket Name</b> - Once created, the bucket name cannot be changed.</li>
        <li><b>Bucket Type</b> - Once a <codeph>memcached</codeph> or <codeph>couchbase</codeph>
          bucket has been created, its type cannot be changed.</li>
        <li><b>View index replicas</b> - <xref href="../indexes/mapreduce-view-replication.dita"
            >View index replicas</xref> cannot be enabled/disabled once a bucket has been created.
        </li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To edit the bucket settings:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Under <uicontrol>Data Buckets</uicontrol>, click the blue triangle preceding the bucket name.</li>
      <li>Click on the <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> button. <p><image
            href="../admin/picts/bucket-settings-edit.png" id="image_wh4_mkk_3v" align="left"
            width="720"/></p> The <wintitle>Configure Bucket</wintitle> dialog offers the same
        options as the <xref href="create-bucket.dita#topic_fym_kmn_vs">Create a New Bucket</xref>
        dialog.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also change bucket settings using the CLI command <xref href="../cli/cbcli/bucket-edit.dita#reference_hhk_gmn_ls">bucket-edit</xref> or the 
      <xref href="../rest-api/rest-bucket-parameters.dita#rest-bucket-change">bucket REST api</xref>.</p>

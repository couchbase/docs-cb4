    <p>Both recovery methods add the server node back into the cluster during the rebalance
      operation. However, full recovery removes the node's data prior to the rebalance and delta
      recovery schedules the node's existing data to be reused.</p>
<section>
      <title>Full Recovery</title>
     
      <p>Full recovery characteristics are as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data files are removed from the server node.</li>
        <li>Indexes must be rebuilt on the server node that is being re-added.</li>
        <li>A working set of documents is restored for the vBuckets that are being moved. </li>
        <li>It is used when the data size is smaller than the bucket quotas. In this case, moving
          data over the network and on the disk (full recovery) may be faster than warming up data
          files (delta recovery).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section><title>Delta Node Recovery</title>
      <p>Delta node recovery permits nodes to be re-added to the cluster 
        and incrementally caught up with the data changes.</p>
      <p>Delta node recovery permits a failed over node to be recovered by re-using the data on its 
        disk and then resynchronizing the data based on the delta change. 
        The failed over node is checked to identify the point when data mutations stopped and resynchronized beginning at that point. 
        The server node catches up on data mutations for its vBuckets and starts serving data. 
        Because the original data and data buckets are retained, the cluster starts functioning with minimal downtime.
        
        Index nodes retain their index definitions when being failed over and recovered using delta recovery, although the data
        within the indexes is deleted. 
        When they are re-added to the cluster, the indexes will be automatically rebuilt by the Index service.
      
        This operation improves recovery time and network resource usage.
        
        Server nodes are removed from clusters under many circumstances. 
        The following are circumstances (among many others) where a server node might be re-added to the cluster after being failed over.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node goes down for a short period of time</li>
        <li>Routine maintenance is scheduled</li>
        <li>Network connectivity is briefly disrupted</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a node is failed over, data files are preserved. 
        The data files are used either for Couchbase support, data recovery, or delta node recovery.</p>
      <p>In the process of failing over a node, performing maintenance, adding the node back into the cluster, 
        and rebalancing, data is recovered via either full recovery mode or delta recovery mode. 
        With delta recovery mode, Couchbase detects (with the Database Change Protocol) 
        which data files are up-to-date and which are out-of-date and then, during rebalance, 
        the existing data files on the failed over server node are retained and the out-of-date files are updated.</p>
      <p>From the web console, the Delta Recovery and Full Recovery options display after the server node is failed over. 
        Both recovery methods add the server node back into the cluster during the rebalance operation, 
        however, full recovery removes the node's data prior to the rebalance and delta recovery 
        schedules the node's existing data to be re-used.</p>
      <p>Delta recovery requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A healthy server node and a healthy state for the cluster.</li>
        <li>The server node is failed over. Delta recovery is not possible for 
          a rebalance-in operation (add server) or rebalance-out operation (remove server).</li>
        <li>Delta recovery must be possible for all buckets. 
          For example, if delta recovery is possible for a subset of buckets but not possible for another 
          subset of buckets, then the Couchbase cluster does not permit a rebalance operation.</li>
        <li>Because delta recovery relies on the existing data files on the failed over server node's disk, 
          the exact same set of buckets must be transferred to the failed over server node.</li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>Delta recovery characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data files are "warmed up" into memory. Warmed up into memory means that data is loaded into memory. 
          As a minimum, depending on whether metadata is retained in or not, all data file keys are loaded
          from disk prior to the rebalance operation.</li>
        <li>Index definitions are retained on the node being recovered. Once the node has been re-added, these
        indexes are automatically rebuilt by the Index service.</li>
      </ul>   
      
      <note type="tip">An environment with a large data footprint might use delta node recovery when re-adding a failed over server node.</note>
      <p><b>Failure Scenarios</b></p>
      <p>There are conditions where delta node recovery either defaults to full recovery or is not available.</p>
      <p>The following are conditions for delta node recovery failures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If topology changes occur while a node is pending delta recovery, delta node recovery is impacted. 
          For example, another node is added, a node is removed, or a node is swapped.</li>
        <li>If a down node is hard failed over and is marked for removal.</li>
        <li>If rebalance-in-out operations are performed where the number of in and out nodes do not match (swap rebalance works in this case).</li>
        <li>If certain bucket operations are performed while a node is pending delta recovery, delta node recovery is impacted. 
          For example, a new bucket is added, a bucket's replica configuration is changed, or a bucket is flushed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following describes scenarios where delta node recovery either defaults to full recovery or is not available.</p>

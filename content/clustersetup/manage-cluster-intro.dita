 <title>Cluster setup</title>
 <shortdesc>Setting up a cluster involves defining file locations and defining
  hostnames.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <section><title>Cluster setup using the Couchbase Web Console</title>
   <p>The default location of the Couchbase Web Console is
    <codeph>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8091</codeph></p>
   <ol>
    <li>Open the Couchbase Web Console. </li>
    <li>Click <uicontrol>Setup</uicontrol> to begin the initial configuration. <p><image
     href="../admin/picts/cluster-setup-01.png" id="image_wmt_pbd_dt" align="left"/></p></li>
    <li>Set up the disk storage and Data service. <p>The <wintitle>Configure Disk
     Storage</wintitle> option specifies the location of the persistent storage used by the
     Couchbase Server Data service. The setting affects only this node and sets the directory
     where all the data is stored on disk. It also sets the location where the indexes created
     by views are stored:</p><ul>
      <li>If you are not indexing data with views, you can accept the default setting. Otherwise
       for the best performance we recommend specifying separate physical storage for the data
       and index paths. </li>
     </ul></li>
    <li> Provide a node IP or hostname under <wintitle>Configure Server
     Hostname</wintitle>. </li>
    <li>Choose which <xref href="../concepts/multidimensional-scaling.dita#concept_ckt_svy_zs"
     >services</xref> to include on the first node. At a minimum, the Data service is required.
     In production, only one service per node should be deployed. </li> 
    <li>The <wintitle>Configure Server Memory</wintitle> section sets the amount of physical RAM
     that will be allocated by the Couchbase Server for storage, both for the Data and the Index
     service. The same amount of memory is allocated to each node in the cluster that runs the
     particular service. Since the same setting applies to the whole cluster, specify a value
     that all nodes of each service type can support. <p>Alternatively, if joining an existing
      cluster, select the radio button <uicontrol>Join a cluster now</uicontrol> and then
      provide the IP address or hostname of an existing node and administrative credentials for
      that existing cluster. Select the services to install on this node. </p></li> 
    <li>Click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>.
     <p>The <wintitle>Sample Buckets</wintitle> panel appears where you can select the sample data buckets you want to load.</p></li>
    <li>Click the names of sample buckets to load to the Couchbase Server. These data sets
     demonstrate Couchbase Server's features and help you understand and develop views and N1QL
     Queries. <p>If you decide to install sample data, the installer creates one Couchbase bucket
      for each set of sample data you choose. </p><p><image
       href="../admin/picts/cluster-setup-02.png" id="image_cst_vfd_dt" align="left"/></p>
     <p> After you create sample data buckets, the <wintitle>Create Bucket</wintitle> panel
      appears where you create a new default data bucket.</p></li>
    <li>Set up a test bucket for Couchbase Server. You can change all bucket settings later, except for the bucket name.</li>
    <li>Accept all defaults in this panel.
     <p>Couchbase Server will create a new data bucket named <codeph>default</codeph>. 
      You can use this test bucket to learn more about Couchbase Server and use it in a test environment.</p></li>
    <li>Select <uicontrol>Enable software update notifications</uicontrol>. Couchbase Web Console
     communicates with Couchbase Server nodes and confirms the version numbers of each node.
     <p>As long as you have Internet access this information will be sent anonymously to
      Couchbase corporate, which uses this information only to provide you with updates and
      information to help improve Couchbase Server and related products. When you provide an
      email address, it is added to the Couchbase community mailing list for news and update
      information about Couchbase and related products. You can unsubscribe from the mailing
      list at any time using the Unsubscribe link provided in each newsletter.</p>
     Couchbase Web Console communicates the following information: <ul>
      <li>The current version. When a new version of Couchbase Server exists, you get
       information about where you can download the new version.</li>
      <li>Information about the size and configuration of your Couchbase cluster to Couchbase
       corporate. This information helps prioritize the development efforts.</li>
     </ul></li>
    <li>Read the terms and conditions and then select <codeph>I agree to the terms and conditions
     associated with this product</codeph> and click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>.</li>
    <li>Enter a cluster administrator's username and password. Your username can have up to 24 characters, and your password must have 6 to 24 characters. 
     Use these credentials each time you add a new server into the cluster. These are the same credentials you use for Couchbase Server REST API.</li>
    <li>After you finish this setup, you see the Couchbase Web Console with the Cluster Overview page. Couchbase Server is now running and ready to use.

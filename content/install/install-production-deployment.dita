		<p>Proper configuration of I/O subsystems is critical for the optimal performance and
			operation and performance of Couchbase Server. These are the most common best practices recommended for storage configuration:</p>
		
		<section><title>General recommendations</title> 
			
			
			<dl>
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Use RAID 1+0 (or RAID 1) if replication factor is 1</dt>
					<dd>If replication factor is 2 or higher, the system administrator can rely on database-level
						replication for data durability.</dd>
				</dlentry>

					<dt><xref

						>Multi-Dimensional Scaling</xref> (MDS)</dt>
					<dd>MDS functionality allows separation of Index and Query services from the traditional
						Couchbase Server data/view services. With MDS and if it fits your use case
						needs, you can have different disk storage configurations for cluster nodes
						running the Data service and different ones running the Index service. For
						example, nodes running the Index service could have SSD backed storage for
						better performance. Refer to <xref
							href="sizing-general.dita#topic_axp_glg_xs"/>for more details.</dd>

				<dlentry>
					<dt>Windows OS</dt>
					<dd>For Windows OS, use 64k allocation sizes on NTFS file systems.</dd>
				</dlentry>
			</dl>

		<section><title>Nodes running the Data service</title>
			
			<dl>
				<dlentry>
					<dt> Isolate the data and indexes</dt>
					<dd>For the best performance, isolate the data and indexes (note that these are different from
						the Index Service) at the physical disk level. </dd>
					
				</dlentry>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Combine different workloads</dt>
					<dd>Combining different workloads (workloads with very different I/O and latency characteristics)
						can have a negative effect on the overall performance. In case of combined workloads, it might
						be appropriate to have objects in different buckets and the files for each bucket on different
						mount points/paths.</dd>

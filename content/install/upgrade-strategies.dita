  <body>
    <p>The following upgrade strategies are available: <ul>
        <li>Standard online upgrade</li>
        <li>Swap rebalance online upgrade </li>
        <li>Offline upgrade</li>
        <li>Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)</li>
      </ul>Both the online and offline upgrade processes have trade-offs. The following table
      illustrates some important aspects of the two upgrade strategies.</p>

   <note type="important">Mac OSX does not support a direct upgrade. When upgrading on this
      platform, first back up your data and perform a clean uninstall of the old version. Once you
      install the new version, restore the data back to the new cluster.</note>

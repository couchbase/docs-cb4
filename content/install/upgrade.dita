  <title>Upgrading Couchbase Server</title> <shortdesc>Periodically upgrading Couchbase Server helps maintain a properly functioning cluster and offers new features. Upgrading is a relatively simple process that usually incurs zero downtime.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Upgrading Couchbase Server regularly is vital to keep your cluster running well. New releases of Couchbase Server provide both bug fixes and new features. For each release, read the release notes to ascertain if there are bugs that might affect a running cluster or features that might be beneficial.</p>
    <p>For an overview of the new features in Couchbase Server version 4.5, check out the <xref
        href="../release-notes/relnotes.dita#topic_gbk_tyh_t5">release notes.</xref></p>
    <section><title>When to do an Upgrade</title>
      <p>If you can, it is best to upgrade during off hours. Avoid upgrading during the system’s peak usage times. 
        Even though rebalances are designed to be a background process, they can impact performance.

        the supported upgrade paths.</p>
      <p>Although infrequent, there may be times when an upgrade to an intermediate version is required before getting to the latest release.</p>

    <section><title>Preparing for an Upgrade</title>
      <p>Before upgrading your production cluster, be sure to test the upgrade process in a test environment that matches your production environment as closely as possible.</p>  
      <p>For each upgrade type mentioned above, there is an example checklist to help you start. </p>

    <section><title>Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</title><p>In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition
        version 4.0+ the Data, Query, and Index Service workloads can all be independently scaled to
        isolate workloads. This feature is called <term>Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</term>.
      </p>While all nodes are part of a cluster, each node in the cluster might only run one or more
      services. For example, consider a seven-node cluster: three nodes run only the Data Service,
      two nodes run only the Indexing Service and two nodes run just the Query Service. In this
      example, each workload is isolated to a set of nodes. There are special considerations for
      most online upgrade options in an MDS cluster. For more information on this, see <xref
        href="upgrade-online.dita#topic_t2x_k2v_xs"/>.
      <!-- <p>In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition version 4.0+ the Data, Query, and Index Services
        workloads can all be independently scaled to isolate workloads. While all nodes are part of
        the cluster, each node in the cluster might only run one or more of the services. For
        example, there is a seven-node cluster. Three nodes are running just the Data Service; two
        nodes are running the Indexing Service, and two nodes are running the Query service. Each
        workload may be isolated to a node</p>   
    <p>If the cluster uses multiple service types, upgrade each type in a rolling manner. While
        upgrading, focus on nodes that support a given service to ensure that the service is not
        disrupted during the upgrade, then move to upgrading the next service. You could also group
        the nodes. For example, while upgrading a query service node, swap in a new query service
        node so you continue to have that service available. Even better would be to have enough
        nodes for the upgrade that you can always have the full capacity of the cluster. If the node
        has multiple services, ensure that enough of such nodes remain to service requests for the
        different services when upgrading.</p>
      <p>Consider the following additional points about MDS and node service types when planning your upgrade:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You cannot introduce additional node service types when adding a newly upgraded node to
          a cluster consisting of mixed version 3.x and 4.x nodes. If you attempt to upgrade a node
          to 4.x and introduce it back into the cluster with additional services checked before
          upgrading all nodes, you'll see a red warning similar to this: <systemoutput>Attention -
            services parameter is not supported in this cluster compatibility
          mode.</systemoutput></li>
        <li>If the current server quotas are insufficient, you may be prompted to change the server
          quota when adding a node with additional data services selected to a cluster. <p>If you
            are adding additional services to the nodes while upgrading, this can affect the server
            RAM quota, and you will be prompted to adjust it. </p></li></ul>
      
      <sectiondiv><b>Index Service</b>
        <p>The Index service with global secondary indexes (GSI) does not provide built-in replicas.
          Administrators need to create identical indexes on the separate index service nodes to
          gain high availability. </p><p>The Index service also comes with no rebalancing support.
          When a node is removed, GSI on that node are also removed and not moved to another node.
          The index traffic is automatically moved to another node that contains an identical index
          so that the application does not experience downtime. However, when the upgraded Index
          service node is brought back into the cluster, administrators have to rebuild the indexes
          on this node again. When upgrading the Index service, make sure to fulfill these
          requirements: </p><ul>
          <li>Before you upgrade an index service node, ensure there are identical indexes on other
            index service nodes for each index on the node being upgraded.</li>
          <li>Upgrade the node with the Index service and add it back to the cluster using one of
            the recommended techniques (swap rebalance, offline upgrade, and so on).</li>
          <li>Recreate all indexes on the upgraded node.</li>
        </ul></sectiondiv>
      
      <sectiondiv><b>Query Service</b>
        <p>It is best practice to have more than one node in the Query Service for HA reasons, but
          when upgrading and removing individual nodes for the upgrade, pay attention to have enough
          capacity for your queries when you remove a node. If you are upgrading two nodes at a
          time, make sure you do not remove both query nodes at the same time. </p></sectiondiv> --> </section>
    <section><title>Downgrades and Limitations</title>
      <p>Once an upgrade of a single Couchbase Server cluster has started, you can roll back to the previous version as long as at least one node is on the previous version. For example, if you have three nodes upgraded to 4.5 and one still on 4.1.x, you can still roll all nodes back to 4.1.x.</p> 
      <p>Once all nodes in the cluster have been fully upgraded, the window for a rollback of that
        cluster has closed. </p>
     <!-- <p>For more information on the upgrade rollback, see . </p>-->
      <p>If you first upgrade a cluster but then decide to downgrade to a previous version, your
        only option is to set up another Couchbase Server cluster and use XDCR with the target
        cluster being the older version. Follow <xref
          href="upgrade-strategies.dita#topic_y23_jjv_xs/intercluster">Upgrading Using Intercluster
          Replication</xref>, having in mind that the new cluster would be the older version to
        which you are rolling back. </p>

  <!--  <section><title>Upgrading Community Edition to Enterprise Edition</title>
      <p>It is supported and tested to perform the online and offline upgrade options when upgrading
        from Couchbase Server Community Edition to Enterprise Edition. Just remember that Enterprise
        Edition is not free to run in production. If you are interested in upgrading to Couchbase
        Server Enterprise Edition, see <xref href="../introduction/editions.dita#couchbase-editions"
        />.</p>
      <p>If you are performing an offline upgrade from the Community Edition to Enterprise Edition,
        shut down the entire cluster and uninstall Couchbase Server Community Edition from each
        machine. Then install Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition on these machines. The data files
        will be retained, and the cluster can be restarted.</p>

    <section><title>Couchbase Client SDK Upgrades</title>
      <p>If you are upgrading Couchbase Server, you are not required to upgrade the client SDKs the applications use. Couchbase client SDKs are forward and backward compatible, but older client SDKs may not be able to take advantage of new Couchbase Server features. </p> 
      <p>That said, it is strongly encouraged to review periodically the versions of client SDKs
        being used by applications and plan for upgrading periodically. Every month Couchbase
        releases new versions that contain updates, bug fixes and new features for the SDKs.</p>

    <section><title>Precautions for Couchbase Mobile’s Sync Gateway</title>
      <p>Take special precaution when upgrading Couchbase Server if you use the cluster in
        conjunction with <xref
          href="http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.2/get-started/sync-gateway-overview/index.html"
          format="html" scope="external">Sync Gateway</xref></p>
      <p>Sync Gateway versions prior to v1.2 do not support the automatic handling of Couchbase Server cluster topology changes 
        for related buckets. An upgrade of Couchbase used with older versions of Sync 
        Gateway must carefully coordinate a manual reconfiguration of the Sync Gateway service connection between the key points in your upgrade process.</p> 
      <p>It is recommended first to upgrade all Couchbase Sync Gateways to at least version 1.2
        before upgrading the Couchbase Server cluster to which they are connected. </p>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>At which point in the upgrade process will the new features of the upgrade be available?</dt>
          <dd>Once every node in the cluster is upgraded to the target release, the new features of
            that release are available for use. Even if 90% of all nodes are upgraded, the cluster
            is still considered to be on the older revision, and newer features are
            unavailable.</dd>

          <dt>Do I have to upgrade the Couchbase client SDKs?</dt>
          <dd>You are not required to upgrade the client SDKs your applications use when you upgrade
            Couchbase Server. Couchbase client SDKs are forward and backward compatible. You may
            want to upgrade, however, because older client SDKs typically cannot take advantage of
            the newest Couchbase Server features.</dd>
          <dd>It is strongly recommended to verify periodically the version of client SDK being used
            by applications and to plan for regular upgrades. Every month Couchbase releases new
            versions that contain updates, bug fixes and new features for each SDK. For more
            information and release notes, see the supported client SDKs.</dd>

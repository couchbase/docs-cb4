  <title>Performing the Rolling Online Upgrade</title> <shortdesc>A rolling online upgrade is the recommended upgrade process for a Couchbase cluster. </shortdesc>
  <body>
 <!-- <section><title>Standard Online Upgrade</title> 
    
    <p>To use a standard online upgrade, identify one or more nodes to remove from the cluster. </p>
  
      <p>You must ensure that your cluster has adequate capacity to service requests with the
        remaining nodes while the identified nodes are upgraded.</p>
      
      <note type="important">You cannot use the standard online upgrade process if your cluster does
        not have available capacity to service requests with at least one node removed.</note>
      
      <p>Because nodes must be rebalanced out of the cluster, upgraded, and rebalanced back into the
        cluster in a rolling fashion, the standard online upgrade is slower than the swap rebalance
        online upgrade strategy.</p>
      
      <p>Couchbase recommends the swap rebalance online upgrade whenever possible because it
        maintains the cluster capacity always at a steady level throughout the upgrade. Use the
        standard online upgrade only if an upgrade with the swap rebalance is not possible.</p>

  <!--  <section><title>Swap Rebalance Online Upgrade</title>
      
      <p>Online upgrade with the swap rebalance is the preferred upgrade method 
        when there is not enough cluster capacity to service requests once an existing node is removed.</p>
 
        <p>Since each upgraded node requires only one rebalance operation, this strategy is also faster than the standard online upgrade.</p>
        <p>To perform a swap rebalance online upgrade, first add a new node to the cluster  
          and then perform a swap rebalance to shift data from an existing node  to the new one.</p>
        <p>The suggested general procedure is to rebalance and remove a node for upgrade, proceed with a swap rebalance operation as if the removed node was an extra
          or "spare" node; once this is complete, add and rebalance the extra node back into the cluster.</section></p>-->
        
      
    <section><title>Swap Rebalance Example</title>
        <p>You can perform a swap rebalance to upgrade your Couchbase Server nodes without reducing
          your cluster performance due to diminished capacity from missing nodes. </p><p>You need at
          least one extra node to perform a swap rebalance. If you are unable to perform an upgrade
          via swap rebalance, perform a standard online upgrade instead. </p><p><b>Without a spare node available</b>
      </p><p>If you don't have an extra node available, and you have enough cluster capacity to service
        requests after removing one of the nodes, prepare for swap rebalance by first removing an
        existing node to serve as the initial swap node: </p><ol>
          <li>Back up the entire cluster.</li>
          <li>Remove one node from the cluster by selecting <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Manage</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Server Nodes</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Remove Server</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> for the node you wish to remove.</li>
          <li>Click <userinput>Rebalance</userinput>. </li>
          <li>Proceed with the instructions.</li>

<section><title>Swap Rebalance Example with an Extra Node Available</title>

        <ol>
          <li>Install the latest version of Couchbase Server on the extra node that is not yet a
            part of the cluster. For instructions see <xref
              href="upgrade-individual-nodes.dita#topic_tc1_vry_p4"/>.</li>
          <li>Create a backup of your cluster data using the <xref
              href="../cli/cbbackup-tool.dita#cbbackup-tool">cbbackup tool</xref>. </li>
          <li>Open the Couchbase Web Console on an existing cluster node.</li>
          <li>Select <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Servers</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Active Servers</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> to view and manage the cluster nodes. </li>
          <li>Click <uicontrol>Add Server</uicontrol>. </li>
          <li>In the <wintitle>Add Server</wintitle> dialog, provide either a hostname or IP address
            for the new node to be added. Enter your Couchbase Server administrative credentials in
            the fields <wintitle>Username</wintitle> and <wintitle>Password</wintitle> and select
            the appropriate service.
          </li>
          <li>Remove one of your existing old nodes from the cluster. <p>Under <menucascade>
                <uicontrol>Server Nodes </uicontrol>
                <uicontrol>Servers</uicontrol>
              </menucascade>, click <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol> for the node you want to remove to
              mark it for removal.</p></li>
          <li>In the <wintitle>Servers</wintitle> panel, click <uicontrol>Rebalance</uicontrol>. The
            rebalance process moves data from the existing node to your newly added node. </li>
        </ol><p>Repeat these steps for all the remaining old nodes in the cluster. You can add and
          remove multiple nodes from a cluster. However, always add the same number of nodes from
          the cluster as you remove.  </p><p>For example, the addition of 4 nodes and the
          removal of 4 nodes is classed as a swap rebalance, but the addition of 7 nodes and removal 
          of 4 nodes is not.</p></section>

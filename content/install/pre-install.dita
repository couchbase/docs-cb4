  <section> <title>Minimum Specification </title>
  <p>Hardware and software requirements may vary depending on the machine and operating system.</p>
   
     <p>The minimum hardware specifications to install and effectively operate Couchbase Server
        are:</p>
     <ul>
       
       <li>Dual-core x86 CPU running at 2GHz. </li>
       <li>4GB RAM (physical).</li>
       <li>A block-based storage device (hard disk, SSD, EBS, iSCSI). </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Network file systems such
       as CIFS and NFS are not supported.</p> 
     <note type="important">You can reduce the CPU and RAM resources below the above-specified
        minimum for development and testing purposes. The specification can be as low as 1GB of free
        RAM beyond operating system requirements and a single CPU core. However, you must use at
        least the required minimum specification for production. </note>

     <title>Recommended Specifications</title><p>The recommended hardware specifications to install and effectively operate Couchbase Server include:</p>
    
       <ul>
         <li>Four core 64-bit x86 CPU running at 3GHz; six cores when using Cross Datacenter
           Replication (XDCR) and Views.</li>
         <li>16GB RAM (physical).</li>
         <li>A local block-based storage device (hard disk, SSD). Network filesystems such as CIFS
          and NFS are not supported.</li>
       </ul>
     <p>These recommended specifications do not take into account your intended workload. You should
        follow the sizing guidelines detailed in <xref href="sizing-general.dita">Sizing Guidelines</xref> when deciding on machine specifications to run
        Couchbase Server.</p>

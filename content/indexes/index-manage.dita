      <p>Issuing the <codeph>CREATE INDEX</codeph> command is considered the first part of a two phase process.
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare phase - This phase occurs when the <codeph>CREATE INDEX</codeph> command is issued. 
            Index metadata (for example, ID and topology) is generated and storage is allocated for the new index. 
            The <codeph>CREATE INDEX</codeph> command is issued either at the command line via the Query service or 
            by an application through the Query service.</li>
          <li>Load phase - This phase occurs when the  <codeph>BUILD INDEX</codeph> command is
            issued. A mutation stream is initiated for the new index and the indexer process and
            stores the primary or secondary keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The datastore client posts the GSI deployment parameter as part of index definition to the index manager. 
        The index manager is responsible for processing the deployment plan.</p>
      <p>A single node in nodes[] parameter is supported. The node parameter used should be the
        Couchbase Server management address of the index node. </p>
      
      <p>Multiple indexes are supported on different nodes to be part of the build list for BUILD
        INDEXES command. Since we do not have global index manager, the datastore client needs to
        evaluate with parameter to identify target node and post index create request to the
        corresponding node. For BUILD INDEXES request, if there are indexes belonging to multiple nodes
        specified in the plan, multiple build requests are posted to each node.</p>
      <p>When an indexer receives a create-index request, the create-index request has a metadata
        parameter which contains two fields (nodes and is_defered_build). If is_defered_build=false,
        indexer starts building the index and returns success immediately. The request processing does
        not block wait until the index is build completely. because the index build may fail (under
        different types of situations) during the build phase</p>
      <p>When an indexer receives a build-indexes request, it validates whether indexes specified in the
        list are present in the current indexer. If all the indexes specified in the list are present, it
        performs a group initial build for those indexes. Otherwise,  an error is returned with
        information.</p>
      <p>If an index drop request arrives while an indexer is in created-not-build state or it is in
        building state, indexer drops the index and removes it from group building internal indexer
        session.</p>
      <p>Index list command:</p>
      <codeblock>TBD</codeblock>
      <p>The indexer enhances the current index list command by adding status code and status messages
        for the indexer. This status code/message can be used by administrators to know about the index
        build progress or the occurrence of error in an index state.</p>
      <p>The Index state is accompanied by a human-readable message. The message is empty when in normal
        states (for example, ONLINE), and filled for non-normal states (for example, the index having
        failed due to out-of-disk space).</p>
      <p>Deferred builds are OFFLINE until the build command is issued.</p>

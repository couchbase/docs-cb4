 <title>N1QL in Couchbase </title>
 <shortdesc>N1QL provides a SQL like query language for Couchbase. Unlike views, N1QL does not require a dedicated index. You can use N1QL to issue ad hoc queries on data.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>If you are using N1QL in your application and querying data using a variety of different
   attributes, you need fast query lookups and scans at a high throughput. Indexes boost N1QL query
   look ups and scans. These indexes have different architectures which are based on view indexes,
   or global secondary indexes (GSI). </p>

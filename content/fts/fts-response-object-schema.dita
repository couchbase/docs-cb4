    <p></p>
    <section><title>Status</title>
      <p>The status object returns the number of successful and failed pindex queries. This
        information is useful as you can choose to use partial results depending on your application
        use case. For example, you may prefer to show an incomplete list of hits for a catalog
        search than return an error message if some pindexes are unresponsive.</p> <p>We recommend that you check the status object for failures rather than rely on the HTTP response codes alone. For example,FTS returns an HTTP 200 response in case of pindex failures or timeouts (not consistency timeouts). This is done so that you can choose to accept partial results in an application. However, this also means FTS returns an HTTP 200 response even when ALL pindexes fail. </p>
      <p>Refer to the following table for more information about the possible status messages. <table

          <dt>Total</dt>
          <dd>The <codeph>total</codeph> field returns an integer representing the total number of
            pindexes queried. This value varies depending on how your index is configured, the
            platform you're running on, and whether you are querying an index or an index alias.
            Each index has a setting for number of vBuckets per pindex. For example, when running on
            a cluster with 1024 vBuckets and with an index setting of 171 vBuckets per pindex, the
            total number of pindexes is 6. When you query an <xref

              <codeph>total</codeph> is the sum of all the pindexes in each index that is included
            in the definition of the index alias. </dd>

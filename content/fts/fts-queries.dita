      Understanding Queries
  </title>
    
    <shortdesc>
        Full Text Search allows queries to be performed on Full Text Indexes. Queries can be performed
        by means of the Couchbase Web Console, the Couchbase REST API, or the Couchbase SDK.

          Query-Specification Options
        </title>
      
         <p>
             Full Text Search allows a range of query options. These include:
         </p>
         
         <ul>
             
             <li>
                 Input-text and target-text can be <i>analyzed</i>: this transforms input-text into 
                 <i>token-streams</i>, according to
                 different specified criteria, so allowing richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching.
                 
                 <p>
                     
                 </p>
             </li>
             
             <li>
                 The <i>fuzziness</i> of a query can be specified, so that the scope of matches can be constrained to
                 a particular level of exactitude. A high degree of fuzziness means that a large number of partial
                 matches may be returned.
                 
                 <p>
                     
                 </p>
             </li>
             
             <li>
                 Multiple queries can be specified for simultaneous processing, with one given a higher <i>boost</i> than
                 another; so ensuring that its results are returned at the top of the set.
                 
                 <p>
                     
                 </p>
                 
             </li>
             
             <li>
                 <i>Regular expressions</i> and <i>wildcards</i> can be used in text-specification for search-input.
                 
                 <p>
                     
                 </p>
             </li>
             
             <li>
                <i>Compound</i> queries can be designed, such that an appropriate conjunction or disjunction of the total 
                result-set can be returned.
                 
                 <p>
                     
                 </p>
             </li>
             
         </ul>
         
         <p>

            Sorting Results

        <p>
          The results returned from a Full Text Search can be <i>sorted</i>: by <b>id</b>, <b>score</b>, <b>field</b>, and more.
          Details are provided in

          Query Response Objects
        </title>
        
        <p>
          Every Full Text Search query provides a <i>response object</i>. This
          contains the query-result; and consists of individual child-objects that 
          respectively contain <i>status</i>, 
          a <i>request-copy</i>, the number
          of <i>hits</i> (or matches) achieved, and (optionally) <i>facets</i>, which 
          provide aggregation information.

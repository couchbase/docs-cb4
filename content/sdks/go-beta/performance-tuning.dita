 <title>Performance tuning</title>
 <shortdesc>Follow the guidelines to effectively use your computing resources.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Though the Go SDK and Couchbase Server are extremely performant, you can follow these
   guidelines to ensure the most effective use of your computing resources:</p>
  <ul id="ol_abl_mwq_t4">
   <li>Couchbase bucket connections are relatively expensive to establish in relation to the
				operations performed on them. Because of this, you should open each bucket only once per
				application instance. Due to multiplexing performed within the SDK, opening multiple
				connections can cause issues and will not benefit performance in most cases.</li>
   <li>Don't use too many views and buckets. A large number of buckets or views can negatively
				affect the performance of Couchbase Server and any connected clients.</li>
   <li>Performing multiple operations simultaneously increases throughput and is important to
    achieving the best possible operation speeds. This is possible by using the
     <codeph>BulkOp</codeph> structures along with the <codeph>Do</codeph> method of a Bucket.
    These structures and method allow you to build a list of operations to perform, and execute them
    simultaneously (though not atomically).</li>
  </ul>

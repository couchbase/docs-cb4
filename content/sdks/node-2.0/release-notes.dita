				<li>The querying interface for N1QL is currently not capable of streaming rows

		<section>
			<title>Version 2.0 Beta 1</title>
			<p>Version 2.0 Beta 1 is the first beta release of the Node.js SDK version 2.0. This
				release includes new documentation, new API reference, and a tested interface that
				represents all committed features. Various uncommitted and experimental features might
				change prior to the final release of version 2.0.0.</p>

			<p>Enhancements and behavioral changes
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A new API has been developed for this new release. This includes a more
					developer-friendly CRUD operation interface, improvements regarding view and N1QL
					queries, and an enhanced cluster and bucket management interface. See the
					documentation and API Reference for further details.</li>
				<li>The view querying interface has been rewritten to permit streaming of rows as they
					are available rather than waiting for the whole result set before dispatching.</li>
				<li>Many of the bulk operation methods have been removed (except for getMulti). These
					operations were previously available primarily for performance reasons, however this
					performance benefit has now been integrated into all operations.</li>
				<li>The API Reference has been revamped to provide many more details regarding all
					events, classes and their methods.</li>
				<li>Numerous performance enhancements have been made within the underlying library,
					libcouchbase, which powers the Node.js SDK. </li>
			</ul>





			<p>Known issues
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Due to changes in the handling of document metadata, it is imperative that in
					mixed-version environments, all Node.js clients must be upgraded to a minimum of
					version 1.2.4 prior to deploying any 2.0.0 clients.</li>
				<li>The built-in Mock testing interface has been updated to match the new API changes,
					however, the view mocking engine has not yet been ported. This means attempts to
					execute view queries against Mock will currently fail with a "not supported"
					exception. This will be ported prior to the GA release of 2.0.0.</li>
				<li>The querying interface for N1QL is currently not capable of streaming rows
					individually and instead only emits a single callback after all results have been
					aggregated. This is scheduled to be corrected shortly after the release of DP4 of the
					N1QL Query Engine.</li>
				<li>Specifying an incorrect number of servers for replica read or durability
					requirements will cause the operation to time out rather than emitting an error as
					intended. This is expected to be fixed following the libcouchbase 2.4.1 release.</li>
			</ul>

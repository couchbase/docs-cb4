			<section>
				<title>Couchbase Java Client 2.2.2 GA (12 November 2015)</title>
				<p>Version 2.2.2 is the second bug fix release of the 2.2 series. It brings many
					bug fixes, stability improvements as well as smaller enhancements.</p>
			</section>

      		<section id="ga222-features">
				<title>New features and behavioral changes</title>
				<p>This release contains the following enhancements:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-871" format="html" scope="external">JCBC-871</xref>: The <codeph>N1qlQueryResult</codeph> (and async variant) has been extended to now also expose the <codeph>Status</codeph> as a string, allowing for more fine grained matching and reporting on potential errors.</li>


					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-256" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-256</xref>: In the next minor version, a blocking version of the <codeph>shutdown</codeph> method on the Environment will be introduced. In order to make the impact smaller, the current <codeph>shutdown</codeph> method on the <codeph>CouchbaseEnvironment</codeph> has been deprecated and explicitly refers to the new <codeph>shutdownAsync</codeph> method.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-863" format="html" scope="external">JCBC-863</xref>, <xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-870" format="html" scope="external">JCBC-870</xref>: While it is still best practice and heavily encouraged to cache and reuse <codeph>Bucket</codeph> references, effort has been made to reduce the impact of potential misuse. The client now caches open bucket instances and reuses them where possible if many subsequent <codeph>openBucket</codeph> calls are performed.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="ga222-fixes">
				<title>Fixed issues</title>
				<p>This release fixes the following issues:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>RxJava has been upgraded to 1.0.15 to address shutdown-cleanup related issues. In-depth discussion of this topic can be read <xref href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/3149" format="html" scope="external">here</xref>.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-864" format="html" scope="external">JCBC-864</xref>: The remove operation, when used with the durability requirements now properly honors the CAS when provided inside the <codeph>Document</codeph>. It now correctly throws <codeph>CASMismatchExceptions</codeph> when the CAS does not match with the server. Previously, the supplied CAS was ignored and the remove operation perfomed without optimistic concurrency checks.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-263" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-263</xref>: A bug in the view query parser has been uncovered which would make it hang when the key in particular includes a closing <codeph>}</codeph>, but no opening <codeph>{</codeph> inside a string.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-262" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-262</xref>: The logic which performs proactive load of new configurations through the "Carrier Publication" mechanism now only targets nodes where the KV-Service is enabled. This is important in MDS scenarios so that it doesn't ask nodes where only the query and/or indexing services are enabled.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-102" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-102</xref>: The initial bootstrap process has been made more resilient to individual node failures, fixing a bunch of bugs around initial bootstrapping. Especially the case where one of the nodes is not responding and opening a <codeph>memcached</codeph> type bucket now works correctly (this involves internally skipping over not responding nodes as well as falling back from carrier publication to the http bootstrapping approach).</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-257" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-257</xref>, <xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-265" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-265</xref>: The configuration management logic has been improved in various places, making it more resilient to failed bucket open attempts (cleaning up the state properly) as well as optimizing the proactive config loading approach when no bucktes are open or are currently being closed. In particular, one issue has been resolved where an asynchronous open bucket attempt with a fallback to a good one did not work previously.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-266" format="html" scope="external">JVMCBC-266</xref>: The client now proactively checks if the document ID is null, empty or too large where it can be directly passed in. Previosuly the operation would fail with the server responding <codeph>INVALID_ARGUMENTS</codeph> where now it is very clear what the root cause of the issue is. The client now fails the observable right away with an <codeph>IllegalArgumentException</codeph> explaining what the problem is.</li>

					<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-865" format="html" scope="external">JCBC-865</xref>: In the N1QL builder API, the an invalid query was generated when multiple WHEN blocks are used in the CASE statement, leading to query errors. This issue has been fixed, the client now emits correct N1QL statements in those cases.</li>
				</ul>

			<title>Couchbase Java Client 2.2.0 GA (2 September 2015)</title>
			<p>Version 2.2.0 is the first release of the 2.2 series and brings compatibility with
				Couchbase Server 4.0 as well as lots of new features and enhancements. </p>

		</section>
		<section><title>Migration Notes</title>
			<p>While the 2.2 release does not bring any breaking changes to stable APIs over 2.1, some
				APIs have been modified and unstable APIs renamed. The following information provides
				guidelines on migrating from 2.1.x:</p>

			<ul>

				<li>The <codeph>counter(String id, long delta)</codeph> method and associated overloads
					(custom timeout or with durability requirements) has been modified so that it throws
					a <codeph>DocumentDoesNotExistException</codeph> if the document does not exist.
					Previously, the code automatically initialized the document with 0. The 1.x SDK
					provided a similar feature, so we wanted to bring it back for more flexibility. The
					new code is simple—just use the overload with an initial value of 0: <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// before
bucket.counter("id", 10);

// after
bucket.counter("id", 10, 0);]]></codeblock>
				</li>

				<li>If the CAS is set on the documents used in append/prepend operations and the server
					CAS does not match, previously a generic CouchbaseException was thrown. Now the code
					checks for this response status and returns a more correct
						<codeph>CASMismatchException</codeph>. Because this exception extends the
						<codeph>CouchbaseException</codeph>, your code might still work, although checking
					for this explicit exception type is recommended.</li>

				<li>If you have been using the asynchronous API, be aware that all the asynchronous API methods
					are now returning cold observables instead of hot observables. As a result, you don't
					need to call <codeph>Observable.defer()</codeph> around the bucket calls if you want
					proper retry semantics. If you are doing that already, you can remove the calls (but
					don't have to—it's just a little more overhead). Also, it has been always
					recommended, but make sure to subscribe to all of your observables. Hot observables
					might have been automatically executed, but cold observables won't. Not subscribing
					in general goes against the RX contract.</li>

				<li><p>If you've been implementing your own Document type together with a custom transcoder, you
						now need to implement a new method if you want to use the document together
						with the new feature called enhanced durability. The specific change is that
						you need to add a simple factory method which allows you to pass in the new
							<codeph>MutationToken</codeph>. Your old code will keep working, but for
						future compatibility we recommend adding this new method.</p><p>As an
						example, here is how the <codeph>JsonDocument</codeph> implements the new
						method. If you want, you can also make the older factory method just forward
						to the new one:</p><codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// Pre-2.2, can still be used
@Override
public JsonDocument newDocument(String id, int expiry, JsonObject content, long cas) {
    return JsonDocument.create(id, expiry, content, cas);
}

// New in 2.2
@Override
public JsonDocument newDocument(String id, int expiry, JsonObject content, long cas,
    MutationToken mutationToken) {
    return JsonDocument.create(id, expiry, content, cas, mutationToken);
}]]></codeblock><p>If your document extends from the AbstractDocument, make sure you call the new
						super method with the token instead of the old one:</p><codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[private JsonDocument(String id, int expiry, JsonObject content, long cas, MutationToken mutationToken) {
    super(id, expiry, content, cas, mutationToken);
}]]></codeblock>Make note of the following:</li>

				<li>To make the N1QL queries more consistent with the View queries, all exposed N1QL
					classes have been prefixed with N1QL or been renamed in a slightly different manner
					to make the intent clear. We did rename Query, QueryResult, QueryRow, their
					asynchronous counterparts, concrete implementations and related tests by prefixing
						<codeph>Query</codeph> with <codeph>N1ql</codeph>. Also,
						<codeph>QueryMetrics</codeph> and <codeph>QueryParams</codeph> have been
					respectively renamed to <codeph>N1qlMetrics</codeph> and <codeph>N1qlParams</codeph>.
					Finally, the <codeph>QueryExecutor</codeph> has been renamed to
						<codeph>N1qlQueryExecutor</codeph>.</li>

				<li>Since we are stabilizing the API now, we also had to rename the
						<codeph>parametrized</codeph> query to <codeph>parameterized</codeph>. This is to
					ensure the best possible experience across SDKs and consistent documentation for
					client and server.</li>

	<title>New features and behavioral changes</title>

			<p>This release brings the following features and enhancements:</p>


			<ul>

				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-137" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-137</xref>, <xref
						href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-222" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-222</xref>, <xref
						href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-732" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-732</xref>, <xref
						href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-761" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-761</xref> (and more): Official Couchbase Server 4.0
					Support. This includes mainly a stable and tested N1QL API, as well as support for
					MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling). Use 2.2.0 and later as your go-to release when
					working with CB Server 4.0 and up. </li>


				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-60" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-60</xref>: System and Latency Metrics are now collected in
					an "always on" fashion and emitted to the event bus every hour by default. This is
					all configurable and tunable based on the applications needs. Please consult the
					documentation on metrics to get all the nitty gritty details. </li>

				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-826" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-826</xref>, <xref
						href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-190" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-190</xref>, <xref
						href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-205" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-205</xref>: 4.0 also introduces a new feature called
					enhanced durability, which allows for more accurate durability requirements
					(PersistTo and ReplicateTo). All you need to do is enable the mutation tokens on the
					environment, but keep in mind that there is an increased byte overhead on every
					mutation. <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[// Enable enhanced durability
CouchbaseEnvironment environment = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment.builder()
            .mutationTokensEnabled(true)
            .build();

// Perform an operation as before and benefit from it transparently
bucket.upsert(doc, PersistTo.MASTER, ReplicateTo.ONE);]]></codeblock>
				</li>

				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-744" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-744</xref>: Experimental support for POJO mapping
					capabilities have been added in the form of a repository API. See this <xref
						href="http://blog.couchbase.com/javasdk-2.2-dp" format="html" scope="external"
						>blog post</xref> for more details. Here is a quick example. Right now you need a
					no-args constructor to recreate the object again, we'll make it more flexible with
					explicit constructors in the future so you can use final fields. <codeblock outputclass="language-java"><![CDATA[public static class User {

    @Id
    private String username;

    private String firstname;

    @Field("lname")
    private String lastname;

    public User(String username, String firstname, String lastname) {
        this.username = username;
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
    }

    public User() {}
}

Repository repository = bucket.repository();

User user = new User("daschl", "Michael", "N.");
repository.upsert(EntityDocument.create(user));

System.out.println(repository.get("daschl", User.class).content().firstname);]]></codeblock>
				</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-805" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-805</xref>: The <codeph>getFromReplica()</codeph> method now
					has an overload that returns an <codeph>Iterator</codeph>, making it more flexible on
					the blocking API to only extract one or two results if needed (and don't wait for all
					responses). </li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-749" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-749</xref>: <codeph>includeDocs</codeph> on the ViewQuery
					has been re-added (it was there in 1.x) so that the blocking API can benefit from
					efficient bulk document loading in the background automatically. If you are using the
					asynchronous API only, you won't need this query option.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-784" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-784</xref>: As mentioned in the migration notes above, the
					counter overload with no default value has been enhanced to throw an exception if the
					document does not exist. Previously, it was not possible to only use the counter
					method on documents which exist (they would always be initialized with a default
					value of 0 instead).</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-836" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-836</xref>: Durability Requirements for
						<codeph>append</codeph>, <codeph>prepend</codeph> and <codeph>counter</codeph>
					have been added to the Bucket API. This allows you to observe persistence and
					replication not only on insert, upsert, replace and remove, but also on append,
					prepend and counter. Of course, this all plays well with the new enhanced durability
					feature we've added if you work against the 4.0 server or later.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-782" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-782</xref>: All asynchronous API calls are now "cold", which
					means they are not eagerly run until subscribed by the caller. This won't affect
					basic usage, but makes it easier when doing asynchronous retry logic or branching to
					fallback calls.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-652" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-652</xref>: When creating or replacing a
						<codeph>DesignDocument</codeph>, you can now specify different options which are
					configurable on a per design document basis. Please see the documentation for a list
					of those options.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-237" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-237</xref>: To detect cluster changes in MDS setup more
					reliably, the SDK now polls for a new configuration every 10 seconds. This is
					completely transparent, but can be seen when dumping the network traffic. Note that
					the NOOP heartbeat polling is still in place, only the piggybacked configuration
					reloading has been superseded with this more general approach.</li>
			</ul>

		</section>

<section>
			<title>Fixed issues</title>
			<p>This release fixes the following issues:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-231" format="html"
						scope="external">JVMCBC-231</xref>: A race condition has been fixed during
					shutdown (internal reconfigure), when all nodes are removed.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-834" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-834</xref>: The blocking API for spatial queries was using
					the default timeout for N1QL queries instead of views. They are set to the same value
					by default, but can be changed on the environment separately, probably leading to
					weird behavior if not taken into account.</li>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JCBC-815" format="html"
						scope="external">JCBC-815</xref>: Do not let the
						<codeph>CouchbaseEnvironment.Builder</codeph> implement the
						<codeph>CouchbaseEnvironment</codeph>. This has lead to confusion during
					development and is not necessary.</li>
			</ul>

			<title>Known issues</title>
			<p>This release contains the following known issues to be addressed in subsequent releases:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><xref href="https://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/JVMCBC-242" format="html"

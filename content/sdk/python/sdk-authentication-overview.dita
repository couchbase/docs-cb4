        Authentication
    </title>
    
    <shortdesc>
        RBAC requires that
        users pass appropriate <i>credentials</i> to Couchbase Server in order to access
        cluster-resources. The SDK provides enhanced support for the passing of credentials.

                Passing Credentials

            <p>
                The most recent versions of the SDK are RBAC-enabled, and provide 
                enhanced support for authentication. Code examples for Python can be found in 
                <xref href="./start-using-sdk.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Getting Started with the SDK</xref>,
                and also as part of the
                <xref href="./sdk-user-management-example.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Sample Code</xref>
                provided to demonstrate user management.

                Upgrading to RBAC-Enabled SDK-Versions

            <p>
                The last pre-RBAC version of the Python SDK was 2.2.5. The first RBAC-enabled was
                2.2.6. See the SDK

            <p>
                With the most recent versions of the SDK, the legacy authentication interface
                and
                the new, optimized authentication
                interface can both be used: each supports access to buckets on Couchbase Servers
                whose version is either 5.0 and beyond, or pre-5.0.

                Certificate-Based Authentication
            </title>
            
            <p>
                Couchbase Server supports the use of X.509 certificates to authenticate clients (only available in 
                the Enterprise Edition, not the Community Edition). This allows
                authenticated users to access specific resources by means of the data service (no other service
                is currently available to clients through this form of authentication). 
            </p>
            
            <p>    
                The process relies on a certificate
                authority, for the issuing of certificates that validate identities. A certificate includes
                information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the authority
                that issued the certificate, and the digital signature of the authority.
                A client attempting to access Couchbase Server can present a certificate to the server, allowing
                the server to check the validity of the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the user
                under whose identity the client is running,
                and the roles assigned that user, are verified. If the assigned roles are appropriate for
                the level of access requested to the specified resource, access is granted.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Python SDK has supported certificate authentication since version 2.3.3. The client certificate can be generated with the shell script on 
                the <xref href="../c/sdk-authentication-overview.dita" scope="local" format="dita">C SDK Authentication page</xref>.
                The following is an example of connecting with the Python client, using a certificate:
                <codeblock outputclass="language-python">from couchbase.cluster import *
import os.path

hostname ="localhost"
bucket_name = "default"

# point to certificates, keys, and trust stores;
# for the purposes of this code,
# the script in etc/x509-cert will generate these

clientdir = "etc/x509-cert/SSLCA/clientdir"
options = dict(certpath=os.path.join(clientdir, "client.pem"),
    truststorepath=os.path.join(clientdir, "trust.pem"),
    keypath=os.path.join(clientdir, "client.key"))

# create a Cluster object

cb_cluster = Cluster("http://{}/".format(hostname))

# create an SSL-based Authenticator
authenticator = CertAuthenticator(cluster_username="admin",
    cluster_password="password", **options)
# apply this to the cluster
cb_cluster.authenticate(authenticator)

# user this to open a bucket
cb = cb_cluster.open_bucket(bucket_name)</codeblock>Further examples can be seen in the <xref href="https://github.com/couchbaselabs/devguide-examples/tree/master/python" scope="external" format="html">Devguide examples</xref>.</p>

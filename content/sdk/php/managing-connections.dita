            <title>Configuring the Client</title>
            <p>To configure the client, instantiate a new <codeph>Cluster</codeph> object:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-php">$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster('couchbase://10.4.4.1,10.4.4.2,10.4.4.3');</codeblock>
            <p>In addition to the connection string passed to the <codeph>Cluster</codeph> object,
                you can include a username and password. The username and password are required to
                perform management operations against your cluster. If you do not use the cluster
                management aspects of the SDK, the user name and password parameters are optional.
                Keep in mind that these credentials are the same ones you use to log in to the
                Couchbase administrator console, not those specified for the bucket itself. </p>

            <title>Connecting to a Bucket</title>
            <p>To connect to a bucket, call the <codeph>openBucket()</codeph> method against your
                    <codeph>Cluster</codeph> instance, passing in the name of the bucket that you
                want to connect to. If no bucket name is specified, the default bucket is opened.
                The following example shows how to connect to a bucket:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-php">$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster();
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket('default');</codeblock>
            <p>In addition to the bucket name, you can optionally include the bucket password if one
                has been defined, as shown in the following example:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-php">$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster();
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket('default', 'password');</codeblock>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Disconnecting from a Bucket</title>
            <p>To close the connection to a bucket, call its <codeph>disconnect()</codeph> method.
                This method queues the disconnection of all open connections and causes any pending
                operations to fail. </p>

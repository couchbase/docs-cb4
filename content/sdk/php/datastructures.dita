    <title>Data Structures</title>
    <shortdesc>You can use complex data structures such as maps and lists in Couchbase. These data
        structures may be manipulated with basic operations without retrieving and storing the
        entire document.</shortdesc>

        <p>Data structures in Couchbase are currently an uncommitted feature and are not yet
            implemented in PHP.  This document will be updated as a PHP implementation becomes
            available.</p>
        <p>Data structures as implemented in other SDKs are stored as JSON documents in Couchbase,
            and can therefore be accessed using N1QL, Full Text Search, and normal key-value
            operations. Data structures can also be manipulated using the traditional sub-document
            and full-document KV APIs.</p>

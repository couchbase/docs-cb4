            <title>Error Codes</title>
            <p>An error is received if an operation could not be executed. Sometimes errors are
                received directly from the server while other times they are generated internally by
                the client.</p>
            <p>Most functions in the C SDK return an error code of type
                    <apiname>lcb_error_t</apiname>. As an application developer, you should be
                prepared to handle non-successful error codes and treat them appropriately. If the
                library is not behaving as expected then your first action should be to determine if
                your application is properly handling (and checking) any error codes returned by the
                library. Remember that error codes are only significant when there is an error
                condition!</p>
            <p>A successful operation is defined by the return code of <codeph>LCB_SUCCESS</codeph>,
                while any other code indicates an error condition. You can find a full list of error
                codes in the <filepath>&lt;libcouchbase/error.h></filepath> header.<note>New
                    applications are advised to enable extended error codes by using the
                        <codeph>LCB_CNTL_DETAILED_ERRCODES</codeph> setting (see <xref
                        href="tuning.dita#concept_wtt_2jq_44"/>). Extended error codes are not
                    enabled by default to avoid sending older applications error codes that they
                    cannot handle.</note></p>

        <section>
            <title>When to check for errors, and what they mean</title>
            <p>Success and failure depend on the context. A successful return code for one of the
                data operation APIs (for example, <apiname>lcb_store3()</apiname>) does not mean the
                operation itself succeeded and the key was successfully stored. Rather, it means the
                key was successfully placed inside the library’s internal queue. The actual error
                code is delivered as the <apiname>lcb_RESPBASE::rc</apiname> parameter in the
                operation callback itself (that is, the callback installed with
                    <apiname>lcb_install_callback3()</apiname>).</p>
            <p>Non-successful error codes received in callbacks are <i>usually</i> a result of a
                negative server reply or a network connectivity issue.</p>
            <p>If an error was returned from a scheduling function (e.g.
                    <apiname>lcb_get3())</apiname>, it may be the result of a bad input (see
                    <apiname>LCB_EIFINPUT</apiname>). Scheduling functions may also return
                    <apiname>LCB_NOT_SUPPORTED</apiname> or
                    <apiname>LCB_CLIENT_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE</apiname> which suggest that the server
                or the client do not support the given API.</p>
            <p>If a scheduling API returns anything but <codeph>LCB_SUCCESS</codeph>, the callback
                for that specific request will <i>not</i> be delivered. Conversely, it is guaranteed
                that the callback will always be delivered if the return code for the scheduling
                function is <codeph>LCB_SUCCESS</codeph>.</p>
            <p>You can print a textual representation of the error by using
                    <apiname>lcb_strerror</apiname>. This function is always guaranteed to return a
                valid
                    string<codeblock>lcb_strerror(NULL, LCB_OPTIONS_CONFLICT);</codeblock><note>The
                    first argument to <apiname>lcb_strerror</apiname> is ignored and has never been
                    used.</note></p>

        <title>Handling unresponsive servers</title>
        <body>
            <p>If a server is unresponsive action should be taken to determine the cause and either
                fix the server or fail it over, depending on available replicas and the type of
                problem caused. The client SDK cannot determine if a server is unresponsive and by
                default assumes that any network or server failure is extremely temporary in nature
                and will attempt to reconnect as required.</p>
            <p>If a cluster node is unresponsive and the application determines (through a mechanism
                outside Couchbase) that the node may be unresponsive for some time, it is possible
                to avoid sending operations to that node:</p>
            <p>In Couchbase architecture, keys are mapped to [vBuckets], which in turn are mapped to
                cluster nodes. To avoid sending operations to a specific server, you need to
                retrieve the server index for the key and then the hostname corresponding to that
                index. This is done by using the <i>vBucket</i>
                API:<codeblock>bool maybe_skip_host(lcb_t instance,
                     const std::string&amp; key,
                     const std::vector&lt;std::string>&amp; badhosts) {
    lcbvb_CONFIG *vbc;
    lcb_cntl(instance, LCB_CNTL_GET, &amp;vbc);
    int ix, vbtmp;
    lcbvb_map_key(vbc, keybuf, keylen, &amp;vbtmp, &amp;ix);
    if (ix &lt; 0) {
        // Missing node. See next section!
        return false;
    } else {
        std::string hostname = lcbvb_get_hostname(ix);
        for (size_t ii = 0; ii &lt; badhosts.size(); ++ii) {
            if (hostname == badhosts[ii]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;

        <title>Handling library and application crashes</title>
        <body>
            <section>
                <title>Program crashes and pitfalls</title>
                <p>If your application abnormally terminates while invoking a function with the
                    library, you may have either encountered a bug or passed the library an invalid
                    pointer. Keep in mind the following points:<ul id="ul_djj_bw1_mv">
                        <li>The library is <i>not</i> thread safe. While you may use multiple
                                <i>lcb_t</i> handles in different threads, you must never access the
                            same handle from multiple threads without using external synchronization
                            functions (such as mutexes).</li>
                        <li>The response structures within the callback are valid <i>only</i> in the
                            scope of the callback function itself. This means you must copy the
                            structure (and any contained keys and values) into another location in
                            memory if you wish to use it outside the callback.</li>
                        <li>Callbacks will <i>not</i> be invoked if the scheduling function returns
                            a failure status. This means that the following code will result in
                            accessing uninitialized
                            memory:<codeblock outputclass="language-c">struct myresult {
  char *value;
  lcb_error_t err;
}
static void get_callback(lcb_t instance, int cbtype, const lcb_RESPGET *resp)
{
  struct myresult *mr = (struct myresult *)resp->cookie;
  mr->err = resp->rc;
  if (mr->err == LCB_SUCCESS) {
    mr->value = malloc(resp->nkey + 1);
    memcpy(mr->value, resp->key, resp->nkey);
    mr->value[resp->nkey] = '\0';
  } else {
    mr->value = NULL;
  }
}

// Some lines later
struct myresult mr;
lcb_get3(instance, &amp;mr, &amp;cmd);
lcb_wait(instance);
if (mr.value) {
  // If lcb_get() returned an error, this will be uninitialized access!
  // ...
}</codeblock></li>
                    </ul></p>
                <p>A crash can also be a result of a bug in the library. Sometimes the library will
                    call abort when it detects an inconsistent state. If you think you have found a
                    bug in the library you should file a bug in our <xref
                        href="http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CCBC" format="html"
                        scope="external">issue tracker</xref>. When filing a bug, please be sure to
                    include the library version and any relevant code samples.</p>

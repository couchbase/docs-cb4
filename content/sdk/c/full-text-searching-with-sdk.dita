    <shortdesc>You can use the Full Text Search service (FTS) to create queryable full-text indexes
        in Couchbase Server. This page describes how to use Full Text Search using the C
        SDK.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>Couchbase offers Full-Text search support, allowing you to search for documents that
            contain certain words or phrases. In the C SDK, you can search full-text indexes by
            using the row-based <apiname>lcb_fts_query()</apiname> API (<codeph>#include
                &lt;libcouchbase/cbft.h></codeph> first, though!)</p>
        <p>To use the <apiname>lcb_fts_query</apiname> function, first create an
                <apiname>lcb_CMDFTS</apiname> structure, and populate it with a query. The query
            should be specified as a JSON-encoded string and can be generated using any JSON
            encoder:<codeblock outputclass="language-c">    std::string encodedQuery(
        "{\"query\":{\"match\":\"hoppy\"},\"indexName\":\"beer-search\",\"size\":10}");

    cmd.callback = rowCallback;
    cmd.query = encodedQuery.c_str();

    <section><title>Detailed Examples</title>

            <p>
                The code example below demonstrates the Full Text Search
                API. The example assumes that Couchbase Server is running, and that
                the username <codeph>Administrator</codeph> and
                the password <codeph>password</codeph> provide authorization for performing the searches.
                It also assumes that the <codeph>travel-sample</codeph> bucket
                has been installed.
                For information on creating users and managing roles, see
                <xref href="../../security/security-authorization.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Authorization</xref>.
                For information on installing sample buckets, see
                <xref href="../../settings/settings.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Settings</xref>.
                Don't forget to create an lcb_CMDFTS structure, and populate it with a query, as in
                the first example, above.
            </p>

            <p>
                The example also assumes the existence of three specific Full Text Indexes, defined on the
                <codeph>travel-sample</codeph> bucket. These are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <codeph>travel-sample-index-unstored</codeph>: Uses only the default
                    settings.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <codeph>travel-sample-index-stored</codeph>: Uses default settings, with one exception:
                    dynamic fields are <i>stored</i>, for the whole index.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <codeph>travel-sample-index-hotel-description</codeph>: Indexes only the <codeph>description</codeph>
                    fields of <codeph>hotel</codeph>
                    documents, and disables the <codeph>default</codeph> type mapping. The index
                    has a custom analyzer named <codeph>myUnicodeAnalyzer</codeph> defined on it: the analyzer's
                    main characteristic is that it uses the <b>unicode</b> tokenizer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                See
                <xref href="../../fts/fts-creating-indexes.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Creating Indexes</xref>
                for details on how to create these indexes: they can be created interactively, by
                means of the Couchbase Web Console; however, there may be greater efficiency
                in using the Couchbase REST
                API, as described
                in the section
                <xref href="../../fts/fts-creating-indexes.dita#topic_ksl_wwk_1v/index-creation-with-the-rest-api" scope="local" format="dita">Index Creation with the REST API</xref>.
                The JSON objects that constitute index-definitions (for
                inclusion as bodies to the index-creation REST calls), are provided in
                <xref href="../../fts/fts-demonstration-indexes.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Demonstration Indexes</xref>.

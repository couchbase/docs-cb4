    <title>Data Structures (Developer Preview)</title>
    <shortdesc>You can use complex data structures such as maps and lists in Couchbase. These data
        structures may be manipulated with basic operations without retrieving and storing the
        entire document.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>Data structures in Couchbase are currently an uncommitted feature and are not available
            in the C SDK.  The best way to interoperate with data structures as provided by other
            Couchbase SDKs is to use either full-document operations or sub-document operations.
            The section on <xref href="document-operations.dita#topic_ltm_4n5_2v">Sub-Document
                Operations</xref> shows how C applications can manipulate these data structures.</p>

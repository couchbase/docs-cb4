            <p>The full source code for the tutorial is available <xref
                    href="https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-golang/" scope="external"
                    format="html"> on GitHub couchbaselabs/try-cb-golang</xref>.
                The primary focus of the tutorial is to explain the
                function and theory behind the Couchbase Java client and how it works together with Couchbase Server, and especially new features in versions 4.0/4.5 like <codeph>N1QL</codeph>, <codeph>FTS</codeph> and <codeph>sub-document</codeph>. It makes use of the <codeph>travel-sample</codeph> data set. The code that generates the web application is provided with the source code,
                but is not discussed in this tutorial.

            <title>Specific Go prerequisites and set up</title>
            <p> In addition to the prerequisites mentionned in <xref
                    href="../sample-application.dita"/>, you'll need: <ul>
                    <li>Go 1.6+</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>
                To get set up for the tutorial proper, follow these steps:
                <ul>
                    <li><codeph>git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-golang.git</codeph></li>
                    <li>if you don't want to connect to localhost, change the configuration in
                            <codeph>main.go</codeph> (eg. <codeph>cbConnStr</codeph>).</li>
                    <li>alternatively, go straight to running the project by issuing the following
                        in command line inside the project's directory: <codeph>go run
                            main.go</codeph></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <note type="note">
                <p>If you want to code it yourself, there's currently no "fill-in-the-blanks" branch so you'll have to delete method bodies and try to take it from there.</p>
            </note>

            <title>Walking Through the API</title>
            <p>The following sections lead you through the primary functions of the sample
                application. All of the REST API application code is in the <codeph>main.go</codeph>
                file. The following shows you how to program with the various features and services
                of Couchbase including: <b>connecting</b> to a cluster and bucket, <b>key/value</b>
                iteraction, document <b>query through N1QL</b> and <b>full text searches</b>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Configure and Bootstrap the SDK</title>
            <p><b>Where</b>: <codeph>main()()</codeph></p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Connecting to the <codeph>Cluster</codeph> and getting a reference to a
                    <codeph>Bucket</codeph>, learn to reuse it.</p>
            <p><b>Relevant Documentation Topics</b>: <xref href="managing-connections.dita"/></p>
            <p> The first step is to let the application connect to your cluster and obtain a
                reference to a <codeph>Bucket</codeph> (the Bucket is your entry point for the whole
                storage API). The <codeph>cbConnStr</codeph> variable defines the connection string
                including hostname and protocol for your cluster. The <codeph>cbBucket</codeph> and
                    <codeph>cbPassword</codeph> variables are used separately and get passed to
                    <codeph>OpenBucket</codeph> to actually establish a connection to your bucket. </p>
            <b>Connecting to the Cluster and Bucket</b>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">globalCluster, err = gocb.Connect(cbConnStr)
// error handling elided...

globalBucket, err = globalCluster.OpenBucket(cbBucket, cbPassword)
// error handling elided...</codeblock>
            <p> Both bucket and cluster can be managed through the SDK as well (eg. add views or
                create new buckets), see <xref href="managing-clusters.dita"/> for more information.

            <title>Managing Users using Key/Value API</title>
            <p><b>Where</b>: <codeph>UserLogin() and UserSignup()</codeph></p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Use <codeph>Bucket</codeph> operations and discover the
                    <codeph>Document</codeph> API.</p>
            <p><b>Relevant Documentation Topics</b>: <xref href="document-operations.dita"/>, <xref
                    href="async-programming.dita"/>, <xref href="../subdocument-operations.dita"
                /></p>
            <p> Couchbase is a document oriented database which provides access to your data both
                through its document ID (for high performance access), as well as through views and
                N1QL (as powerful query languages).</p>
            <p> This is noticeable in the API, where the methods reflect Key/Value operations
                    (<codeph>RetrieveIn</codeph>, <codeph>Upsert</codeph>, etc...) and work with a
                    <codeph>Sub Document</codeph> interface that has an <codeph>id()</codeph> and
                requests specific content from the document. The default Document implementation
                accepts a simple representation of JSON as its content. </p>
            <b>Creating new users</b>
            <p> A new user first goes through the <codeph>UserSignup()</codeph> method which
                recieves a POST of <codeph>username</codeph> and <codeph>password</codeph> encoded
                as a JSON object. After registering the user to Couchbase, it uses a JWT encoded
                version of the username to maintain your session. The JWT token is later used
                through further interaction to validate the user session and is created using a
                custom function <codeph>createJwtToken()</codeph>.</p>
            <note type="tip"> The <codeph>"user::"</codeph> prefix is arbitrary to this application,
                this is just a convention that the app uses to obtain unique keys and have
                additional information in it, but the key could have been anything else (even
                sequence numbers or UUIDs) really.</note>
            <p> Here comes the part where we use the Couchbase API to store the document, it's
                rather simple, we use an <codeph>Insert</codeph> method which stores the document,
                if the record already exists, an error is returned instead,
                    <codeph>globalBucket.Insert(userKey, user, 0)</codeph>.</p>
            <p> The resulting JSON data and confirmation is sent back to the client with a success
                or an exception if it failed.</p>
            <note type="tip">When it comes to storing a document, you have a choice of three
                methods: <ul>
                    <li><codeph>Insert</codeph> will only work if no document currently exists for
                        the given ID, otherwise a <codeph>ErrKeyExists</codeph> will be
                        returned.</li>
                    <li><codeph>Replace</codeph> on the contrary will only work if the document does
                        already exist (otherwise a <codeph>ErrKeyNotFound</codeph> is thrown).</li>
                    <li><codeph>Upsert</codeph> will always work, replacing or creating the document
                        as needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </note>
            <p>So the result in fact just contains a JWT (Json WebToken) to identify the new user.
                If there is a problem, an error and non-successful status code will be returned to
                the application.  But what is this <codeph>narration</codeph> object in the
                Result?</p>
            <p>The frontend understands this second part of the Result, the narration, as something
                that it can display in a sort of console, so that users of the application can
                directly get an idea of what is going on on the server side while browsing the app.
                It is kind of like a log, but transmitted to the frontend.</p>
            <b>Checking login by getting the User's document</b>
            <p> In the <codeph>UserLogin()</codeph> method, we check a User's credential and for
                that we need to retrieve the corresponding document of course! Since user documents
                are identified by prefixing their username with <codeph>user::</codeph>, this is
                pretty simple. Using the sub-document <codeph>LookupIn(…).Get("password")</codeph>
                we can request only the precise values we want from the document, in this case the
                password: </p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go"><![CDATA[globalBucket.LookupIn(userKey).Get("password").Execute()]]></codeblock>
            <p> If that particular key doesn't exist, the <codeph>LookupIn()</codeph> method returns
                    <codeph>ErrKeyNotFound</codeph>. That's useful to check if the user exists at
                all.</p>
            <p> Otherwise it's just a matter of checking the hashed password with the one provided
                by the user, and responding accordingly.</p>

            <title>A First N1QL Query: Finding Airports</title>
            <p><b>Where</b>: <codeph>FlightSearch()</codeph></p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Use N1QL and the DSL to perform your first <codeph>SELECT</codeph> on Couchbase.</p>
            <p><b>Relevant Documentation Topics</b>: <xref href="n1ql-queries-with-sdk.dita"/>.</p>
            <p> In the SDK, we have a <codeph>ExecuteN1qlQuery</codeph> method that accepts a
                    <codeph>N1qlQuery</codeph> structure and performs a N1QL query against the
                cluster.</p>
            <note type="tip">N1QL is a super-set of SQL, so if you're familiar with SQL you'll feel at ease.</note>
            <p>
                Statements can be provide either in String form or using the DSL. So let's issue our first <codeph>SELECT</codeph> using the DSL!
            </p>
            <p> We'll want to select just the airport name from relevant documents in our
                    <codeph>bucket</codeph>. Since we want to filter relevant document on a criteria
                that depends on the input length, we always start our query with "SELECT airportname
                FROM `travel-sample`".</p>
            <p>
                Then we can chose the correct fields to look into depending on the length of the input. The user can enter
                either a ICAO or FAA code or a full name of an airport to search for, so we accommodate each scenario as we
                build the N1QL statement.  We also use wildcards in the statement to give a free form expression:
            </p>
            
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">var queryStr string
if len(searchKey) == 3 {
  queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE faa='%s'", strings.ToUpper(searchKey))
} else if len(searchKey) == 4 &amp;&amp; searchKey == strings.ToUpper(searchKey) {
  queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE icao ='%s'", searchKey)
} else {
  queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname like '%s%%'", searchKey)
}</codeblock>
            
            <p> The statement is ready! You can execute this statement by wrapping it in a
                    <codeph>N1qlQuery()</codeph> using <codeph>gocb.NewN1qlQuery(queryStr)</codeph>
                and invoking <codeph>globalBucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery()</codeph>. Here it is very
                simple, no placeholders and no particular tuning of the query is necessary, so we'll
                use the simple method: <codeph>globalBucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery(q, nil)</codeph>
            </p>
            <p>The results of the query are return in a result object, which we can then iterate
                over to build a array of the results:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">respData.Data = []jsonAirport{}
var airport jsonAirport
for rows.Next(&amp;airport) {
	respData.Data = append(respData.Data, airport)
	airport = jsonAirport{}
}</codeblock>

        <section>
            <title>More Complex Queries: Finding Routes</title>
            <p><b>Where</b>: <codeph>FlightSearch()</codeph></p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Let the DSL guide you into making more complex N1QL queries.</p>
            <p><b>Relevant Documentation Topics</b>: <xref href="n1ql-queries-with-sdk.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>
                In this class, we have two more complex queries. The first aims at going from human-readable airport name for
                the departure and arrival airports to FAA codes:
            </p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-sql">SELECT faa AS fromAirport FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname = "Los Angeles Intl"
  UNION SELECT faa AS toAirport FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname = "San Francisco Intl"</codeblock>
            <p>
                The second aims at constructing the result set of available flight paths that connect the two airports:
            </p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-sql">SELECT a.name, s.flight, s.utc, r.sourceairport, r.destinationairport, r.equipment
  FROM `travel-sample` AS r
  UNNEST r.schedule AS s
  JOIN `travel-sample` AS a ON KEYS r.airlineid
  WHERE r.sourceairport = "LAX" AND r.destinationairport = "SFO" AND s.day = 6
  ORDER BY a.name ASC</codeblock>
            
            <note type="tip">
                Yes, you read that right, N1QL can do joins (on a single bucket or on several). It works as long as the "foreign
                key" described by <codeph>ON KEYS</codeph> clause can be mapped to a document's Key in the joined bucket.
            </note>
            <p>
                A specificity of N1QL that we see in the second statement is <codeph>UNNEST</codeph>. It extracts a sub-JSON and
                puts it at the same root level as the bucket (so its possible to do joins on each element in this sub-json as if
                they were entries in a left-hand side bucket).
            </p>
            <p>
                For this final step, try to obtain the equivalent of these statements via the DSL and see how it guides you
                through the possibilities of the query language.

        <section>
            <title>Indexing the Data: N1QL &amp; GSI</title>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Use the Index DSL to make sure data is indexed for N1QL to query it.</p>
            <p>
                Index management is a bit more advanced (and is already done when loading the sample), so now that you've learned
                about N1QL, you can have a look at it. There is no code example in this application, but some is presented below for
                your reference.</p>
            <p>For N1QL to work, you must first ensure that at least a
                <codeph>Primary Index</codeph> has been created. For that you can use the DSL from the <codeph>Index</codeph> class:
            </p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">q := gocb.NewN1qlQuery("CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`")
_, err := globalBucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery(q, nil)</codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also create secondary indexes on specific fields of the JSON, for better performance:
            </p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">q := gocb.NewN1qlQuery("CREATE INDEX `def_username` ON `travel-sample`(username)")
_, err := globalBucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery(q, nil)</codeblock>
            <p>
                In this case, give a name to your index, specify the target bucket AND the field(s) in the JSON to index.
            </p>

            <title>Full Text Search: Finding Hotels</title>
            <p><b>Where</b>: <codeph>HotelSearch()</codeph></p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: Use FTS to search for matching Hotels. Use sub-document API to fetch the relevant data for each hit.</p>
            <p><b>Relevant Documentation Topics</b>: <xref href="full-text-searching-with-sdk.dita"/>,
                <xref href="../subdocument-operations.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>
                In this service, we look for hotels using more fuzzy criteria like the content of the address or the description
                of a hotel, using FTS. Once we get some hits, we fetch only the relevant data for each hit to be displayed in the
                UI using the sub-document API.
            </p>
            <p>Let's have a look at the <codeph>HotelSearch()</codeph> method. It accepts two
                parameters via HTTP, <codeph>location</codeph> and <codeph>description</codeph>,
                which are the two possible refining criteria for a hotel search.</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">qp := cbft.NewConjunctionQuery(cbft.NewTermQuery("hotel").Field("type"))</codeblock>
            <p>A <codeph>ConjunctionQuery</codeph> allows you to combine multiple FTS queries into one, as an AND operation. That search
                always includes an exact match criteria that restricts it to the <codeph>hotel</codeph> data type (as reflected
                in the <codeph>type</codeph> field of the JSON document).</p>
            <p>If the user provided a location keyword, we add a second component to the FTS query that will look for that keyword
                in several address-related fields of the document. That is done in an OR fashion, using a <codeph>Disjunction</codeph>
                this time:</p>
            <pre>if location != "" &amp;&amp; location != "*" {
	qp.And(cbft.NewDisjunctionQuery(
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(location).Field("country"),
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(location).Field("city"),
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(location).Field("state"),
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(location).Field("address"),
	))
}</pre>
            <p>Similarly, if a description keyword was provided by the user, we look at the freeform text <codeph>description</codeph>
                field and <codeph>name</codeph> field of the document:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">if description != "" &amp;&amp; description != "*" {
	qp.And(cbft.NewDisjunctionQuery(
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(description).Field("description"),
		cbft.NewMatchPhraseQuery(description).Field("name"),
	))
}</codeblock>
            <p>The <codeph>MatchPhraseQuery</codeph> can contain several words and will search for variations of the words
                (eg. including plural forms or words with the same root...).</p>
            <p>The compound FTS query is now ready to be executed. We build a <codeph>SearchQuery</codeph> object out of it, which
                also determines which FTS index to use ("hotels") and allows us to set various parameters (like a limit of maximum
                100 hits to return). The query is logged (and kept for narration) then executed, returning a
                <codeph>SearchQueryResult</codeph> object:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">q := gocb.NewSearchQuery("travel-search", qp).
	Limit(100)
rows, err := globalBucket.ExecuteSearchQuery(q)</codeblock>
            <p>You then iterate over the resulting
                FTS hits, so we can then fetch the hotel document corresponding to each hit. Actually, we'd prefer to fetch only
                the parts of the document that will be displayed in the UI. That's where the sub-document API comes in!</p>
            <p>Sub-document allows you to fetch (or mutate) a specific set of paths inside a JSON document, without having to transmit the
                whole document back and forth. This can save bandwidth if the document is huge and the parts that you're interested
                in are few. So here we iterate over the results of the FTS search and trigger a subdoc call:</p>
            <codeblock outputclass="language-go">for _, hit := range rows.Hits() {
	res, _ := globalBucket.LookupIn(hit.Id).
		Get("country").
		Get("city").
		Get("state").
		Get("address").
		Get("name").
		Get("description").
		Execute()
	// We ignore errors here since some hotels are missing various
	//  pieces of data, but every key exists since it came from FTS.

	var hotel jsonHotel
	res.Content("country", &amp;hotel.Country)
	res.Content("city", &amp;hotel.City)
	res.Content("state", &amp;hotel.State)
	res.Content("address", &amp;hotel.Address)
	res.Content("name", &amp;hotel.Name)
	res.Content("description", &amp;hotel.Description)
	respData.Data = append(respData.Data, hotel)
}</codeblock>
            <p>Each FTS hit is represented with a structure with each document's <codeph>id</codeph>
                in a <codeph>Id</codeph> field. We can use the sub-document API dedicated to
                fetching data (<codeph>globalBucket.LookupIn(…)</codeph>) and specify what fields we
                want: country, city, state, address, name and description. In the rest of the code,
                the address-related fields are checked for some empty values and then aggregated
                together and the data we obtained is returned as a JSON document for the
                browser.</p>

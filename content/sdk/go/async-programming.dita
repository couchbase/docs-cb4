  <title>Asynchronous Programming</title>
  <body>
    <p>The Go SDK offers a synchronous blocking interface for single operations. You can also <xref
                href="document-operations.dita#toplevel/bulk-ops">batch multiple operations</xref>
            using the <apiname>Bucket.Do()</apiname> interface.  In addition to providing a batch
            methods for use within a single goroutine, the Go SDK is also designed to be highly
            performant when used across numerous goroutines, this allows you to start numerous
            asynchronous goroutines which can all perform operations on the same Bucket and Cluster
            objects.</p>
        <p>Internally, the Go SDK is based upon the <apiname>gocbcore</apiname> package. The
                <apiname>gocbcore</apiname> interface is considered volatile but contains a
            callback-based API that does not block the application.</p>

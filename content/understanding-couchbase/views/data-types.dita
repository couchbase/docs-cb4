  <shortdesc>This section describes how the views system relates to stored data.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The Couchbase query system relies on the information being formatted as a JSON document. The formatting
      of the data in this form enables the individual fields of the data to be identified and
      used.</p>
    <p>When data is stored into the Couchbase database, the data is parsed. 
      If the data is identified as valid JSON, then the data is tagged and identified as valid JSON. 
      If the information cannot be parsed as valid JSON, then it is
      stored as a verbatim binary copy of the submitted data.</p>

    <note type="note">When retrieving the stored data, the format of the information depends on whether the data
      was tagged as valid JSON or not.</note>

  <title>Writing Spatial Views</title>
  <shortdesc>Spatial views use a single spatial function that is similar to the map function used in 	MapReduce views.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>A major difference between MapReduce views and spatial views is that spatial views don't have
      a map and a reduce function. Spatial views have only a single so-called <term>spatial
        function</term>, which is very similar to the map function in MapReduce views.</p>
    <p>To create a spatial view, use the <codeph>emit()</codeph> function. The
        <codeph>emit()</codeph> function parameters are a key and value. The key must be a
      multidimensional bounding box. </p>

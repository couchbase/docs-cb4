  <title>Querying All Data</title>
  <shortdesc>This query retrieves all data based on the GeoJSON polygons example.</shortdesc>
  <refbody>
    <section><title>Description</title>
      
      <p>The results are either viewable in the web console or are returned when the spatial view
        is queried without any additional parameters. In both cases, all documents are
        retrieved.</p>
      
      <note type="note">There isn't a specific ordering, expect it to be arbitrary. Once the view
        file is updated, the order might change.</note>

      <p>The following example is based on the GeoJSON polygon data and the associated spatial view function.</p>

      <p>The individual rows contain the total_rows (which is always 0), document ID, the key that
        got stored, the emitted value, and geometry. The key gets automatically calculated and is
        the enclosing bounding box of the emitted geometry. When refining the query, the key is
        always used for comparison.</p>

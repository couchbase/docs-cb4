      <p>
        The following forms of index are available:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <i>Primary</i>: Provided by the <i>Index Service</i>, this is 
          based on on the unique key of every item in a specified bucket. Every primary
          index is maintained asynchronously. A primary index is intended to
          be used for simple queries, which have no filters or predicates.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <i>Secondary</i>: Provided by the <i>Index Service</i>, this is based
          on a key <i>within</i> a document. The value associated with the key 
          can be of any type: scalar, object, or array. 
          
          <p>
            A secondary index is frequently referred to as a <i>Global Secondary
            Index</i>, or <i>GSI</i>. This is the kind of index used most frequently
            in Couchbase Server, for queries performed with the <i>N1Ql</i> query-language.
            GSIs are also used by the <i>Analytics</i> service.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <i>Full Text</i>: Provided by the <i>Search Service</i>, this is
          a specially purposed index, which contains targets 
          derived from textual and other contents of documents within one or more 
          specified
          buckets. Text-matches of different degrees of exactitude can be
          searched for. Both input and target text-values can be purged of
          irrelevant characters (such as punctuation marks or html tags).
        </li>

  Global Secondary Indexes
 </title>
 
 <shortdesc>
  A <i>Global Secondary Index</i> (GSI) supports queries made by the <i>Query Service</i> on attributes within
  documents. Extensive filtering is supported.

  <p>
   Global Secondary Indexes provide the following:

  </p>

   <ul>
    
    <li>
     <i>Predictable Performance</i>: Key-based operations maintain predictable low-latency, even in
     the presence of a large number of indexes. Index-maintenance is non-competitive with key-based
     operations, even when data-mutation workloads are heavy. 
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     <i>Low Latency Querying</i>: Since the 
     <xref href="../../services-and-indexes/services/query-service.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Query Service</xref>
     accesses GSIs, rather than data maintained in documents, it is not obliged to track how original and replica
     <xref href="../../buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.dita" scope="local" format="dita">vBuckets</xref>
     are dispersed across nodes running the 
     <xref href="../../services-and-indexes/services/data-service.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Data Service</xref>. Moreover,
     since the GSIs reside on specific cluster-nodes running the <i>Index Service</i>, the Query Service can access the GSIs
     directly, without needing to use hashing routines.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     <i>Advanced Scaling</i>: GSIs can be assigned independently to selected nodes,
     without existing workloads being affected.

   <title>Creating Global Secondary Indexes</title>
   
   <p>
    Both Primary and Secondary indexes can be created by means of the N1QL query-language; using the CREATE INDEX
    statement and the USING GSI clause. For more information, see 
    <xref href="../../../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/createindex.dita"/>.

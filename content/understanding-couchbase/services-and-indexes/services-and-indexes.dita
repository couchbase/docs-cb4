    Services and Indexes
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Couchbase Services support access to and maintenance of data. This includes the provision of
    <i>indexes</i>, which enhance the performance of query and search operations.

      <p>
        Services are configured and deployed by the Full Administrator who initializes
        Couchbase Server on one or more nodes. The standard configuration sequence allows
        a subset of services to be selected per node, with an individual memory-allocation for each. Each service supports
        a particular form of data-access or maintenance. Services not required can be
        omitted. Services intended to support a heavy workload can be deployed across
        multiple cluster-nodes, to ensure optimal performance and resource-availability.

        Indexes
      </title>
      
      <p>
        <i>Indexes</i> are required by certain services, such as
        <i>Query</i>, <i>Analytics</i>, and <i>Search</i>, as targets 
        specified for search-routines. 
        Each index makes a predefined
        subset of bucket-data available for the search.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The <i>Query</i> and <i>Analytics</i>
        services both rely on indexes provided by the <i>Index</i> service. The
        <i>Search</i> service provides its own indexes, internally.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Indexes, when well-designed, provide significant enhancements to the performance of
        search operations.

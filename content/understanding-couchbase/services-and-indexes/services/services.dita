      <p>
        Couchbase Server provides the following services: 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <b>Data</b>: Supports the storing, setting, and getting of data-items, specified by
          key. 
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Query</b>: Parses queries specified in the <i>N1QL</i> query-language, executes
          the queries, and returns results. The Query Service interacts with both the
          Data and Index services.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Index</b>: Creates indexes, for use by the <i>Query</i> and <i>Analytics</i>
          services.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Search</b>: Create indexes specially purposed for <i>Full Text Search</i>. This
          supports language-aware searching; allowing users to search for,
          say, the word <codeph>beauties</codeph>, and additionally obtain
          results for <codeph>beauty</codeph> and <codeph>beautiful</codeph>.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Analytics</b>: Supports large, ad hoc join, set,
          aggregation, and grouping operations; which are expected to
          be long-running and highly consumptive of memory and CPU resources.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Eventing</b>: Supports near real-time handling of changes to
          data: code can be executed both in response to document-mutations, 
          and as scheduled by timers.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
      </ul>

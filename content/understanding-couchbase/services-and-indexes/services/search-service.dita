    <p>
     <i>Search</i> represents <i>Full Text</i> search. The indexes that it creates and
     uses are entirely separate from and different to those of the <i>Index Service</i>.
     Full Text Search provides extensive capabilities for natural-language
     querying. These include:
    </p>
   
   <ul>
    
    <li>
     <i>Language-aware</i> searching; allowing users to search for, say, the word
     <codeph>beauties</codeph>, and additionally obtain results 
     for <codeph>beauty</codeph> and <codeph>beautiful</codeph>.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     <i>Scoring</i> of results, according to relevancy; allowing
     users to obtain result-sets that only contain documents awarded the highest
     scores. This keeps result-sets manageably small, even when the total number of documents
     returned is extremely large. 
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     <i>Fast indexes</i>, which support a wide range of possible text-searches. 
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    
    
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    The Search Service requires the Data Service, but does not require, and has no relation to
    the Index Service or Query Service. 
   </p>

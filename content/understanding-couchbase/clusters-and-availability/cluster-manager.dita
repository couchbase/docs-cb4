    Understanding the Cluster Manager
   </title>
   
   <p>
    The <i>Cluster Manager</i> is responsible for the following:
   </p>
   
   <p>
    
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Managing membership of the cluster: adding and removing nodes, discovering
     and tracking topology
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Maintaining cluster-wide layout of services 
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Rebalancing loads, as cluster-topology changes
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Monitoring the health of nodes, and handling failover
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Data-placement: distributing original and replica data across the cluster
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Gathering and aggregating statistics, and managing logging services
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Authentication and role-based authorization.

    Cluster Manager Architecture
   </title>
   
   <p>
    The architecture of the Cluster Manager is illustrated as follows:
   </p>
  
   <image href="./images/clusterManagerArchitecture.png"  width="700" id="cluster_manager_architecture"/>
    
   <p> 
    The modules are: 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    
   </p>
     
   <ul>
    
   <li>
    <b>REST API and Auth</b>: Cluster Manager communication and authentication happen through the 
    REST API and Auth modules. All administrative operations performed through CLI tools or 
    Admin Portal are executed through the admin REST API.
    
    <p>
     
    </p>
   
   </li>
    
   <li>
    <b>Master Services</b>: manages global cluster level operations such as master and replica 
    vbucket placement, auto failover and rebalance.
    
    <p>
     
    </p>
   
   </li>
    
   <li>
    <b>Bucket Services</b> 
    manages bucket level operations such as establishing or handing off replication for 
    replica maintenance or bucket level stats collection. 
    
    <p>
     
    </p>
   
   </li>
    
   <li>
    <b>Per-node Services</b> manage node health and process/service monitoring and restart.
    
    <p>
     
    </p>
   
   </li>
    
   <li>
    <b>Cluster manager generic local and distributed facilities</b> also manage local and distributed 
    configuration management, cluster-wide logging and more.
    
    <p>
     
    </p>
   
   </li>
  </ul>

  <section><title>Node Membership: Adding and Removing Nodes Without Downtime</title>
   <p>The Cluster Manager is responsible for cluster membership. When the topology of a cluster changes, the Cluster Manager walks through a set of carefully orchestrated operations to redistribute the load while keeping the existing workload running without a hiccup.</p>
   <p>The following workflow describes the high-level operations to add a new node to the data service: <ol>
    <li>The Cluster Manager ensures the new nodes inherit the cluster configuration. </li>
    <li>In order to redistribute the data to the new nodes,  the Cluster Manager initiates rebalance and recalculates the vBucket map. </li>
    <li>The nodes which are to receive data initiate DCP replication streams from the existing nodes for each vBucket and begin building new copies of those vBuckets.  This occurs for both active and replica vBuckets depending on the new vBucket map layout.</li>
    <li>Incrementally as each new vBucket is populated, the data replicated and the indexes optionally updated, an atomic switchover takes place from the old vBucket to the new vBucket.</li>
    <li>As the new vBuckets on the new nodes become active, the Cluster Manager ensures that the new vBucket map and cluster topology is communicated to all the existing nodes and clients. This process is repeated until the rebalance operation completes running. </li>
   </ol> 
   </p>
   <p>Removal of one or more nodes from the data service follows a similar process by creating new vBuckets within the remaining nodes of the cluster and transitioning them off of the nodes to be removed. When there are no more vBuckets assigned to a node, the node is removed from the cluster. </p>
   <p>When adding or removing nodes from the indexing and query services, no data is moved and so their membership is simply added or removed from the cluster map. The client SDKs automatically begin load balancing across those services using the new cluster map.</p>

  <section id="section_sv4_jgz_pz"><title>Node Failure Detection</title><p>Each node within a
    Couchbase Server cluster communicates with one another via a heartbeating mechanism.
    Traditionally, these heartbeats are sent between the cluster managers on all nodes at regular
    intervals. The heartbeats contain basic statistics about the node, which are used to assess the
    health of the node.</p><p dir="ltr">For the purposes of automatic failover, one node is
    designated as the orchestrator based on an election by the other nodes. This orchestrator is
    then responsible for keeping track of the heartbeats received from other nodes. If automatic
    failover is enabled, then after a specified period of time given by the automatic failover
    timeout period, if no heartbeats have been received from a node the orchestrator node will
    automatically failover the node. This is dependent on other criteria being met as detailed on
     <xref href="../../clustersetup/automatic-failover.dita#topic_fcf_chm_zs"/> such as only a single
    node being unhealthy.</p><p dir="ltr">This approach is fairly brittle and susceptible to 'false
    positives', that is a node being identified as offline even if the service on that node (e.g.
    Query, Data etc) continues to serve traffic without issue. Additionally, as the orchestrator is
    solely responsible for deciding which nodes to failover it is vulnerable to issues such as
    network partitions. </p><p dir="ltr">To mitigate these issues, the monitoring of node health is
    performed by a node monitor, which exists outside of the cluster management process, rather than
    the cluster manager itself. This node monitor is responsible for monitoring the services which
    are running on the node and including this information in heartbeats. The node monitor
    heartbeats are similar to the cluster manager heartbeats in that they are exchanged between all
    nodes, but these heartbeats contained much more detailed information. Each node then decides
    whether a particular node is healthy based on the heartbeats that it receives from the node. A
    node is only considered for automatic failover if every other node reports that it is
    unhealthy.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently the following services are monitored:</p><ul
    id="ul_kqm_kgz_pz">
    <li dir="ltr">
     <p dir="ltr"><b>Cluster Manager</b> - The cluster management process' health is assessed by
      monitoring the basic heartbeating that the cluster manager performs. If the cluster manager is
      not sending out its basic heartbeats to other nodes then it is considered unhealthy.</p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
     <p dir="ltr"><b>Data Service</b> - The health of the Data service is monitored by inspecting
      the DCP
       traffic coming out of the node. If the memcached process is not sending data or no-ops
      (internal keep-alives) along its connections then it is considered unhealthy.</p>
    </li>
   </ul>This monitoring is then used to more accurately inform the decision about whether to
   automatically failover a node. By using specific service monitoring, the chance for 'false
   positives' is greatly reduced, although it is still vulnerable to an unstable network. </section>
  <section id="RZA"><title>Smart Data Placement with Rack and Zone Awareness</title>
   <p>Couchbase Server buckets physically contain 1024 master and 0 or more replica vBuckets. The Cluster Manager master services module governs the placement of these vBuckets to maximize availability and rebalance performance.</p>
   <p>The Cluster Manager master services module calculates a vBucket map with heuristics to maximize availability and rebalance performance. The vBucket map is recalculated whenever the cluster topology changes. The following rules govern the vBucket map calculation: <ul>
    <li>Master and replica vBuckets are placed on separate nodes to protect against node failures. </li>
    <li>If a bucket is configured with more than 1 replica vBucket, each additional replica vBucket is placed on a separate node to provide better protection against node failures. </li>
    <li>If server groups are defined  for master vBuckets (such as rack and zone awareness capability),  the replica vBuckets are placed in a separate server group for better protection against rack or availability zone failures.</li>
   </ul></p>
  </section>
  <section><title>Centralized Management, Statistics, and Logging</title>
   <p>The Cluster Manager simplifies centralized management with centralized configuration management, statistics gathering and logging services. All configuration changes are managed by the orchestrator and pushed out to the other nodes to avoid configuration conflicts. </p>

   <p>In order to understand what your cluster is doing and how the cluster is performing, 
    Couchbase Server incorporates a complete set of statistical and monitoring information. 
    The statistics are accessible through all the administration interfaces - CLI ( cbstats tool), REST API, and the Couchbase Web Console.</p>

   <p> The Couchbase Web Console provides a complete suite of statistics including the built-in real-time graphing and performance data. It gives great flexibility as you (as an Administrator) can aggregate the statistics for each bucket and choose to view the statistics for the whole cluster or per node. </p>
   <p>The statistics information is grouped into categories, allowing you to identify different states and performance information within the cluster. <dl>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Statistics on hardware resources</dt>
     <dd>Node statistics show CPU, RAM and I/O numbers on each of the servers and across your cluster as a whole. This information is useful to identify performance and loading issues on a single server.</dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Statistics on vBuckets</dt>
     <dd>The vBucket statistics shows the usage and performance numbers for the vBuckets. This is useful to determine whether you need to reconfigure your buckets or add servers to improve performance.
     </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Statistics on views and indexes</dt>
     <dd>View statistics display information about individual views in your system such as number of reads from the index or view and its disk usage, so that you can monitor the effects and loading of a view on the Couchbase nodes. This information can indicate that your views need optimization, or that you need to consider defining views across multiple design documents.</dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Statistics on replication (DCP, TAP, and XDCR)</dt>
     <dd>The Database Change Protocol (DCP) interface is used to monitor changes and updates to the database. DCP is widely used internally to replicate data between the nodes, for backups with <apiname>cbbackup</apiname>, to maintain views and indexes and to integrate with external products with connectors such as Elasticsearch connector, Kafka connector or the Sqoop connector. XDCR replicates data between clusters and uses DCP in conjunction with an agent that is tuned to replicate data under higher WAN latencies. <p>TAP is similar to DCP, but is a deprecated protocol. Legacy tools may still use the protocol and stats are still available through the console.</p><p>Given the central role of replication in a distributed system like Couchbase Server, identifying statistics on replication is critical. Statistics in replication help visualize the health of replication and bottlenecks in replication by displaying replication latency and pending items in replication streams. </p>

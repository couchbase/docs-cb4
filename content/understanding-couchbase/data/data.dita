        Items, Keys, and Values
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Each item consists of a key and a value. Each key is unique, within its bucket. Its value 
        can be either binary or JSON.

        Keys
      </title>
          
        <p>
          Each value (binary or JSON) is identified by a unique key. A key may be custom-created
          (for example, at the UI of Couchbase Web Console); or it may be generated by an
          application, possibly using a programmatic counter or UUID generator.
          A key is immutable: once defined, it cannot be changed.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Note that Couchbase also refers to an item's key as its <i>id</i>.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Each key:
        </p>
      
        <p>
        </p>
      
          <ul>
            <li>
              Must be a UTF-8 string with no spaces. Special characters, such as <codeph>(</codeph>, <codeph>%</codeph>, 
              <codeph>/</codeph>, <codeph>"</codeph>, and <codeph>_</codeph>, are acceptable.
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              May be no longer than 250 bytes.
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Must be unique within its bucket.
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>

        Values
      </title>
      
        <p>
          The maximum size of a value is 20 MB. A value can be either:
        </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Binary</b>: Any form of binary is acceptable. Note that a binary cannnot be parsed, indexed,
          or queried.
          
          <p>
          </p>
          
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>JSON</b>: A JSON value, referred to as a <i>document</i>, can be parsed, indexed, and queried. 
          Each document consists of one or more <i>attributes</i>,
          each of which has its own value. An attribute's value can be a <i>basic</i> type, such 
          as a number, string, or Boolean; or a <i>complex</i>, such as an embedded document, or an array. 
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>

        Document Structure

      <p>
       A sample JSON document is provided immediately below. Its contents are as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <codeph>a1</codeph> and <codeph>a2</codeph> are attributes that respectively
          have a single number and a single string as their values.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>a3</codeph> is an attribute whose value is an embedded document consisting of a single
          attribute, <codeph>b1</codeph>, whose own value is an array of three numbers.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>a4</codeph> is an attribute whose value is an array of two
          documents, each document consisting of attributes (<codeph>c1</codeph>, <codeph>c2</codeph>) each of
          whose values is a number.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <codeblock outputclass="language-javascript">{  
  "a1" : number,
  "a2" : "string",
  "a3" : {
    "b1" : [ number, number, number ]
    },
  "a4" : [
    { "c1" : "string", "c2" : number },
    { "c1" : "string", "c2" : number }
  ]
}</codeblock>

        Sub-Documents
      </title>
      
      <p>
        A <i>sub-document</i> is an inner component of a JSON document. The sub-document is referred to by a <i>path</i>,
        which specifies attributes and array-positions.
        </p>
      
      <p>
        From, the example given above, the following paths are among those that
        can be specified.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <codeph>a1</codeph>, whose value is a number
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>a3.b1</codeph>, whose value is an array of numbers
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>a3.b1[0]</codeph>, whose value is the first number in an array
            
            <p>
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>a4[1].c2</codeph>, whose value is a number
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The Couchbase SDK provides a <i>Sub-Document API</i>, which allows paths to be specified,
        and sub-documents thereby read and written to. This makes it unnecessary to transfer entire 
        documents over the network when only partial modifications are required, potentially 
        providing significant improvements in network-performance.

        Meta-Data
      </title>
      
      <p>
        <i>Meta-data</i> is automatically generated and stored for each item saved in Couchbase Server. For
        example, consider the following document, which contains airport-information, and has been 
        saved with the key <codeph>airport_1306</codeph>:
      </p>
      
      <codeblock outputclass="language-javascript">{
  "airportname": "Brienne Le Chateau",
  "city": "Brienne-le Chateau",
  "country": "France",
  "faa": null,
  "geo": {
    "alt": 381,
    "lat": 48.429764,
    "lon": 4.482222
  },
  "icao": "LFFN",
  "id": 1306,
  "type": "airport",
  "tz": "Europe/Paris"
}</codeblock>
      
      <p>
        Couchbase Server generates meta-data in association with the document, when the document is saved. The meta-data might
        be as follows:
      </p>
      
      <codeblock outputclass="language-javascript">{
  "meta": {
    "id": "airport_1306",
    "rev": "1-1526338d1bbb00000000000002000000",
    "expiration": 0,
    "flags": 33554432,
    "type": "json"
  },
  "xattrs": {}
}</codeblock>
      
      <p>
        The attributes within the meta-data are:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>meta</codeph>: The attribute whose value is the standard meta-data document for the saved document, <codeph>airport-1306</codeph>.
          <p></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>id</codeph>: The <i>key</i> of the saved document, which is <codeph>airport_1306</codeph>.
          <p></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>rev</codeph>: The <i>revision</i> or <i>sequence</i> number. This value is for internal server-use only: it is
          used in the resolution of conflicts that occur when replicated documents are updated concurrently on different servers,
          representing the number of times the document has been mutated. For more information on conflict resolution, see
          <xref href="../../xdcr/xdcr-timestamp-based-conflict-resolution.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution</xref>.
          <p></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <codeph>expiration</codeph>: The expiration-time (or <i>Time-To-Live</i>) of the document. If non-zero, this 
          determines the point at which the document is removed from the system. The value can be set in either of
          two ways: per-document, by means of Couchbase SDK APIs (which is referred to as <i>TTL</i>); or
          per bucket, by means of Couchbase SDK APIs, the Couchbase Web Console, the Couchbase CLI, or the
          Couchbase REST API (which is referred to as <i>Bucket TTL</i>).
          
          <p>
            For information on <i>TTL</i>, see

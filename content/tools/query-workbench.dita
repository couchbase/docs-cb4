  <title>Query Workbench</title><shortdesc>The <uicontrol>Query Workbench</uicontrol> provides a rich graphical user interface to
    perform query development.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Using the <uicontrol>Query Workbench</uicontrol>, you can conveniently explore data, create,
      edit, run, and save N1QL queries, view and save query results, and explore the document
      structures in a bucket - all in a single window. </p>
    <p>Features of the Query Workbench include: <ul>
      <li>A single, integrated visual interface to perform query development and testing.</li>
      <li>Easy viewing and editing of complex queries by providing features such as multi-line formatting, copy-and-paste, syntax coloring, auto completion of N1QL keywords and bucket and field names, and easy cursor movement. </li>
      <li>View the structure of the documents in a bucket by using the N1QL <cmdname>INFER</cmdname> command. You no longer have to select the documents at random and guess the structure of the document.</li>
      <li>Display query results in multiple formats: JSON, table, and tree. You can also save the
          query results to a file on disk.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console</uicontrol> > select the
        <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> menu. By default, the <uicontrol>Query Workbench</uicontrol>
      tab is displayed. <note>The Query Workbench only runs on nodes which are running the Query
        service. If the Query service is <i>not </i>running on the current node, it provides a link
        to the nodes in the cluster which <i>are</i> running the Query service.</note></p>
    <p><b>Supported platforms</b></p>
    <p>The Query Workbench is supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms.</p>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Query Workbench</uicontrol> consists of three working areas as shown in the
      following figure: <ul>
        <li><b>Query Editor</b></li>
        <li><b>Bucket Insights</b></li>
        <li><b>Query Results and Plans</b></li>

      </fig></p>
    <section id="n1ql-editor">
      <title>Using the Query Editor</title>
      <p>The Query Editor is where you build queries, and run the queries using the
          <uicontrol>Execute</uicontrol> button. <note type="tip">You can also execute queries by
          typing a semi-colon (;) at the end of the query and hitting
          <uicontrol>Enter</uicontrol>.</note>The Query Editor provides the following additional
        features: <ul>
          <li><b>Syntax coloring</b> - For easy viewing, N1QL keywords, numbers and string literals
            are differently colored.</li>
          <li><b>Auto-completion</b> - When entering a keyword in the Query editor, if you enter the
              <userinput>tab</userinput> key or <userinput>Ctrl+Space</userinput>, the tool offers a
            list of matching N1QL keywords and bucket names that are close to what you have typed so
            far. For names that have a space or a hyphen (-), the auto-complete option includes back
            quotes around the name. If you expand a bucket in the Data Bucket Analysis, the tool
            learns and includes the field names from the schema of the expanded bucket.</li>
          <li><b>Support for N1QL INFER statements</b> - In the Enterprise Edition, the tool
            supports the N1QL <xref href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/infer.dita">INFER</xref>
            statement. </li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
        <section><title>Run a Query</title>After entering a query, you can execute the query by either
      typing ‘;’ and pressing <uicontrol>Enter</uicontrol>, or by clicking the <uicontrol>Execute
        Query</uicontrol> button. When the query is running, the <uicontrol>Execute
        Query</uicontrol> button changes to <uicontrol>Cancel Query</uicontrol> that allows you to
      cancel the running query. When you cancel a running query, it stops the activity on the server
      side as well.<p>
        <note>The <uicontrol>Cancel Query</uicontrol> button does not cancel index creation
          statements. The index creation continues on the server side even though it appears to have
          been canceled from the Query Workbench.</note>
      </p></section>
    <section><title>View Query History</title>The tool maintains a history of all the queries
      executed. Use the arrow keys at the top of the editor to navigate through the history. If you
      edit a previous query and execute it, the new query is stored at the end of the history. The
      history is persistent across browser sessions. Use the <uicontrol>Clear History</uicontrol>
      button if you wish to start over. The query history only saves queries; due to limited browser
      storage it does not save query results. Thus, when you restart the browser or reload the page,
      you can see your old queries, but you must re-execute the queries if you want to see their
        results.<note>Clearing the browser history clears the history maintained by the Query Editor
        as well.</note><p>Click the <uicontrol>history</uicontrol> link, at the top of the editor,
        to open the <wintitle>Query History</wintitle> window. When the window opens, the current
          query is selected.</p><image placement="break" href="images/query-workbench-history.png"
         id="image_p42_tpr_dz"/><p>You can scroll through the entire query history, and
        click to select an individual query to be at the current spot in the history. </p><ul
        id="ul_ufk_jy3_cz">
        <li><b>Search history</b> - You can search the query history by entering a text in the
          search box located on the top. All matching queries are displayed. If no matching query is
          found, then the entire history is displayed. </li>
        <li><b>Delete a specific entry</b> - Click <uicontrol>Delete Selected</uicontrol> to delete
          the currently selected query from the history.</li>
        <li><b>Delete all entries</b> - Click <uicontrol>Delete All</uicontrol> to delete the entire
          query history. </li>
        </ul></section><section>
          <title>History Status</title>
          <p>The currently shown position in the history is
            indicated by the numbers next to the history link. For example, (151/152) indicates that
            query #151 is currently shown, out of a total history length of 152 queries. Use the
            forward or back buttons to move to the next or previous query in the history. The
            forward button can also create a new blank query when you are already at the end of the
            query history.</p>
        </section>
    <section>
      <title>Import Query</title>
      <p>You can load a query from a file into the Query Editor. Click <uicontrol>Import
          Query</uicontrol>, and then select a local file that you wish to import. Alternatively,
        you can drag and drop the file from the Desktop into the <uicontrol>Query Editor</uicontrol>
        to a load a file. The content of the file is added in the <uicontrol>Query
          Editor</uicontrol> as a new query at the end of the history.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Export Query</title>You can save a query to an external text file using the
        <uicontrol>Export Query</uicontrol> button. By default, the query is saved as a text file
      (.txt) in the Downloads directory when using Firefox and Chrome.<p dir="ltr">
        <note>When using Safari, clicking Save loads the data into a new window. You have to save
          the file manually using the <uicontrol>File > Save As</uicontrol> menu.</note>
      </p></section>
    <section><title>Query Preferences</title>You can specify the query settings by clicking the
        <image href="images/query-workbench-settings.png" id="image_jgc_xpr_dz"/>button. The

          <li><b>Refresh Data Buckets</b> - By default, when the Query Workbench is first loaded, it
            retrieves a list of available buckets from the cluster. The <uicontrol>Bucket

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The buckets are grouped into the following categories based on the indexes created for the
        bucket: <ul id="ul_h3j_pdx_1z">
          <li><b>Fully Queryable Buckets</b>: Contain a primary index or a primary index and
            secondary indexes.</li>
          <li><b>Queryable on Indexed Fields</b>: Do not contain a primary index, but have one or
            more secondary indexes.</li>
          <li><b>Non-Indexed Buckets</b>: Do not contain any indexes. These buckets do not support
            queries. You must first define an index before querying these buckets. </li>
        </ul>With the Enterprise Edition, you can expand any bucket to view the schema for that
        bucket: field names, types, and if you hover the mouse pointer over a field name, you can
        see example values for that field. Bucket analysis is based on the N1QL <xref
          href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/infer.dita">INFER</xref> statement, which you can
        run manually to get more detailed results. This command infers a schema for a bucket by
        examining a random sample of documents. Because the command is based on a random sample, the
        results may vary slightly from run to run. The default sample size is 1000 documents. The
        syntax of the command is:
        <codeblock>INFER <varname>bucket-name</varname> [ WITH <varname>options</varname> ]; </codeblock>
        where <varname>options</varname> is a JSON object, specifying values for one or more of

    <section id="results"><title>Viewing the Query Results</title>
      <p>When you execute a query, the results are displayed in the <uicontrol>Query
          Results</uicontrol> area. Since large result sets can take a long time to display, we
        recommend using the LIMIT clause as part of your query when appropriate. </p>
      <p>When a query finishes, the query metrics for that query are displayed on the right side of
        the Execute Query button.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Status - Shows the status of the query. The values can be: success, failed, or HTTP
            codes.</li>
          <li>Elapsed - Shows the overall query time. </li>
          <li>Execution -Shows the query execution time.</li>
          <li>Result Count - Shows the number of returned documents. </li>
          <li>Mutation Count - Shows the number of documents deleted or changed by the query. This
            appears only for UPDATE and DELETE queries instead of Result Count. Result Size: Shows
            the size in bytes of the query result.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can save the results in the JSON format. Click the Export as JSON button, to save the
        results into the JSON file format. Specify the name of the JSON file where results are
        saved, click OK. </p>
      <p>The following figures display the result of the query <codeph>select `travel-sample`.* from
          `travel-sample` LIMIT 1;</codeph> in different formats. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>You can choose to view the results in one of the following formats: <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>JSON Format</dt>
          <dd><p>JSON, where the results are formatted to make the data easy to read. You can also expand and
            collapse objects and array values using the small arrow icons next to the line numbers.

            <dt>Table Format</dt>
            <dd><p>Table, where the results are presented in a tabular format. The tool converts the JSON
              documents to HTML tables, and presents sub-objects or sub-arrays as sub-tables. This format
              works well for queries that return an array of objects, like <codeph>select `beer-sample`.*
                from `beer-sample`;</codeph>. You can hover the mouse pointer over a data value to see the
              path to that value in a tool tip. You can sort a column by clicking the column header.

      <dlentry>
        <dt>Tree Format</dt>
        <dd>Tree (or list), where the results are presented in a tree (or

    <title>Query Plans</title>
      <p>When a query is first executed in the workbench, an ‘explain’ command is automatically run
        in the background to retrieve the query plan that will be used. This query plan may be shown
        as either:</p>
      <p>
        <dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Plan</dt>
            <dd>This is where the results are presented in a graphical format. At the top, it shows
              a summary which also shows lists of the buckets, indexes, and fields used by the
              query. At the bottom is a data-flow diagram of query operators, with the initial scans
              at the right, and the final output on the left. Potentially expensive operators are
              highlighted. Once the query is complete, if you have selected the <uicontrol>Collect
                query timings</uicontrol> option in the preferences dialog, the query plan will be
              updated with timing information (where available) for each operation. You can hover
              the mouse pointer over a data value to see the path to that value in a tooltip. <p>

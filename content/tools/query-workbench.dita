  <title>Query Workbench</title><shortdesc>The Query Workbench provides a rich graphical user interface to perform query development.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Using the Query Workbench, you can conveniently explore data, create, edit, run, and save N1QL  queries, view and save query results, and explore the document structures in a bucket - all in a single window. </p>
    <p>Features of the Query Workbench include: <ul>
      <li>A single, integrated visual interface to perform query development and testing.</li>
      <li>Easy viewing and editing of complex queries by providing features such as multi-line formatting, copy-and-paste, syntax coloring, auto completion of N1QL keywords and bucket and field names, and easy cursor movement. </li>
      <li>View the structure of the documents in a bucket by using the N1QL <cmdname>INFER</cmdname> command. You no longer have to select the documents at random and guess the structure of the document.</li>
      <li>Display query results in multiple formats: JSON, table,and tree. You can also save the query results to a file on disk.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>The Query Workbench is now integrated with the Couchbase Web console and is available on the
        <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> tab. <note>The Query Workbench only runs on nodes which are
        running the Query service.  If the Query service is <i>not </i>running on the current node,
        it provides a link to the nodes in the cluster which <i>are</i> running the Query
        service.</note></p>
    <p><b>Supported platforms</b></p>
    <p>The Query Workbench is supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms. <note
        type="important">This is a beta version of Couchbase Server 4.5 and is intended for
        development purposes only. We consider beta releases to have some rough edges and bugs, and
        may change significantly before the final GA release. This release is <b>not supported</b>
        in production.</note></p>
    <p>The Query Workbench consists of three working areas as shown in the following figure : <ol>
        <li>N1QL Editor</li>
        <li>Bucket Analysis</li>
        <li>Results</li>

      </fig></p>
    <section id="n1ql-editor"><title>N1QL Editor</title>
      <p>The N1QL editor is where you build queries, and run the queries using the <uicontrol>Execute</uicontrol> button. <note type="tip">You can also execute queries by typing a semi-colon (;) at the end of the query and hitting <uicontrol>Enter</uicontrol>.</note>. The N1QL editor provides the following additional features: <ul>
          <li><b>Auto-completion</b> - When entering a keyword in the N1QL editor, if you enter the <userinput>tab</userinput> key or <userinput>Ctrl+Space</userinput>, the tool offers a list of matching N1QL keywords and bucket names that are close to what you have typed so far. For names that have a space or a hyphen (-), the auto-complete option includes back quotes around the name. If you expand a bucket in the Bucket Analyzer, the tool learns and includes the field names from the schema of the expanded bucket.</li>
        <li><b>Query history</b> - The tool maintains a history of all the queries executed in a given session. Use the arrow keys at the top of the editor to navigate through the history. If you edit a previous query and execute it, the new query is stored at the end of the history.  The history is persistent across browser sessions. Use the <uicontrol>Clear History</uicontrol> button if you wish to start over. The query history only saves queries; due to limited browser storage it does not save query results. Thus, when you restart the browser or reload the page, you can see your old queries, but you must re-execute the queries if you want to see their results.<note>Clearing the browser history clears the history maintained by the N1QL Editor as well.</note></li>
          <li><b>Support for N1QL INFER statements</b> - The tool supports a preview of the N1QL
              <xref href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/infer.dita">INFER</xref> statement. This
            command infers a schema for a bucket by examining a random sample of documents. Because
            the command is based on a random sample, the results may vary slightly from run to run.
            The default sample size is 1000 documents. The syntax of the command is:
            <codeblock>INFER <varname>bucket-name</varname> [ WITH <varname>options</varname> ]; </codeblock>
            where <varname>options</varname> is a JSON object, specifying values for one or more of
              <varname>sample_size</varname>, <varname>similarity_metric</varname>,
              <varname>num_sample_values</varname>, or <varname>dictionary_threshold</varname>. <fig
              id="fig_fdv_55q_y5">
              <title>Sample INFER statement: INFER `travel-sample`;</title>

            </fig><note><xref href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/infer.dita">INFER</xref>
              statement is only supported in the Enterprise Edition.</note>
          </li>
          <li><b>Save query</b> - You can save a query to an external text file using the
              <uicontrol>Save Query</uicontrol> button. By default, the query is saved as a text
            file (.txt) in the Downloads directory.<note>When using Safari, clicking
                <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> loads the data into a new window. You have to save the
              file manually using the <menucascade>
                <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
                <uicontrol>Save As</uicontrol>
              </menucascade> menu.</note></li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
    <section id="bucket-analyzer"><title>Bucket Analysis</title>
      <p>The bucket analysis area displays all the buckets installed in the cluster. The buckets are
        grouped into the following categories based on the indexes created for the bucket: <ul>
          <li><b>Fully Queryable Buckets</b>: Contain a primary index or a primary index and
            secondary indexes.</li>
          <li><b>Queryable on Indexed Fields</b>: Do not contain a primary index, but have one or
            more secondary indexes.</li>
          <li><b>Non-Indexed Buckets</b>: Do not contain any indexes. These buckets do not support
            queries. You must first define an index before querying these buckets. </li>
        </ul>With the Enterprise Edition, you can expand the buckets to view the schema. The result
        is the same as using the INFER command on the <cmdname>cbq shell</cmdname>. The analyzer
        scans a sample of 1000 documents and displays multiple flavors of the schema. You can also
        hover the mouse pointer over a field name to see example values for that field.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="results"><title>Results</title>
      <p>When you execute a query, the results are displayed in the result area. Since large result sets can take a long time to display, we recommend using the LIMIT clause as part of your query when appropriate. The following
        figures display the result of the query <codeph>select `beer-sample`.* from `beer-sample`;</codeph> in different formats. You can choose to
        view the result in one of the following formats: <ul>
          <li>JSON (default), where the results are formatted to make the data easy to read. You can
            also expand and collapse objects and array values using the small arrow icons next to
            the line numbers. <image placement="break" href="images/query-workbench-result-json.png" width="570"
                id="image_uqm_h5q_y5"/></li>
          <li>Table, where the results are presented in a tabular format. The tool converts the JSON
            documents to HTML tables, and presents sub-objects or sub-arrays as sub-tables. This
            format works well for queries that return an array of objects, like <codeph>select
              `beer-sample`.* from `beer-sample`;</codeph>.  You can hover the mouse pointer over a
            data value to see the path to that value in a tool tip.<image placement="break"
              href="images/query-workbench-result-table.png" width="570" id="image_pjv_35q_y5"/>
          </li>
          <li>Tree (or list), where the results are presented in a tree (or list or outline) format.
            Each sub-object or sub-array is displayed as a sub-list. You can hover the mouse pointer
            over a data value to see the path to that value in a tool tip.<image placement="break"
              href="images/query-workbench-result-tree.png" width="570" id="image_znv_j5q_y5"/></li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Canceling Running Queries</title>
    <p>You can cancel running queries using the Cancel button on the Query Workbench. When you
        cancel a running query, it stops the activity on the server side as well. <image
          placement="break" href="images/query-workbench-cancel-query.png" width="570"
          id="image_t4z_kcs_3v"/><note>The Cancel button does not cancel index creation statements.
          The index creation continues on the server side even though it appears to have been
          canceled from the Workbench. </note></p>

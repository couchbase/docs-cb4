    <title>Query Consistency and Reading Your Writes</title>
    <shortdesc>In order to make query execution as quick as possible, queries are executed against
        an index. When documents are created, removed, or otherwise modified, the index is updated
        asynchronously.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Because indexes are updated asynchronously, a query that is issued immediately after a
            document mutation may not reflect the recently-executed
            mutation.<codeblock>cb.upsert('user:12345', {
    'names': ['Brass', 'Doorknob'],
    'emails': ['brass.doorknob@juno.com']
})

query = N1QLQuery(
    'SELECT names, emails FROM users WHERE $1 IN names', 'Brass')
for row in cb.n1ql_query(query):
    print row</codeblock>In
            the above example, the <codeph>user:12345</codeph> may not be reflected in the query
            results if the asynchronous index update took place after the query was executed.</p>
        <section><title>Forcing query to wait until the index has been updated</title>It is possible
            to ensure that prior mutations are always considered and indexed when performing the
            query. This option works by instructing the query service to wait for all pending
            mutations to be indexed. The option is off by default to increase performance: in write
            heavy environments, many pending writes may be active and therefore waiting for them all
            to be indexed can slow down the execution time of the server. This option is called
                <codeph>consistency</codeph><codeblock>from couchbase.n1ql import CONSISTENCY_REQUEST
query = N1QLQuery(
    'SELECT names, emails FROM default WHERE $1 IN names', 'Brass')
query.consistency = CONSISTENCY_REQUEST</codeblock>Examples

  Data Compression
 </title>
 
 <shortdesc>
  Couchbase Server supports <i>data compression</i>, both in its communications
  with internal and external clients, and within the server itself.

    Overview
   </title>
   
   <p>
    The compression of data potentially allows a larger working-set to be maintained in RAM. It may
    also reduce consumption of network-bandwith. A slightly higher consumption of CPU resources may occur,
    due to the handling of compression and decompression.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Couchbase data-compression is provided by 
    <xref href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)" scope="external" format="html">Snappy</xref>,
    which is an open-source, compression-decompression library, written in C++. Compression is optionally applied 
    to individual buckets, either by the server or by its clients. Clients elect to participate in exchanges of compressed data
    by using the standard <codeph>HELO</codeph> network command.

        External network clients based on the Couchbase SDK elect to participate in exchanges of compressed
        data by using the <codeph>HELO</codeph> command with flags that confirm support of the <i>Snappy
        Compression</i> datatype. This allows the client to send compressed documents to receive them from the
        server. Such clients must perform their own decompression when necessary.

     Data-Compression Modes
    </title>
   
   <p>
    Couchbase Data-Compression is handled on a per-bucket basis. Each bucket
    is configured to support one of three modes. After a client has negotiated
    the ability to participate in exchanges of compressed data, by means of the
    <codeph>HELO</codeph> flag, the actual handling of data depends on the
    mode supported by the specified bucket. The modes are:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Off
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Passive
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Active
    </li>
    
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    These are described in the following sections.
   </p>
   
  </section>
  
  <section>
   
   <title>
    Data-Compression Mode: Off
   </title>
   
    <p>
     The <i>Off</i> compression mode is sometimes referred to as <i>Legacy</i>, and provides the
     behavior of Couchbase Server 5.0 and pre-5.0. Therefore, on receipt of a compressed document,
     Couchbase Server decompresses the document for storing in memory; and recompresses it
     when storing on disk. When sending the document back to the client, Couchbase Server
     sends the document in uncompressed form.  
    </p>
     
    <p>
     This compression mode is useful where client-side compression is
     either considered too consumptive of CPU resources, or has been so fully
     implemented as to require no compression on the server.
    </p>
   
    <p>
     This mode is assigned by default to buckets <i>upgraded</i> from a previous
     version of Couchbase Server.
    </p>
   
  </section>
  
  <section>
   
   <title>
    Data-Compression Mode: Passive
   </title>
   
   <p>
    On receipt of a compressed document,
    Couchbase Server stores it <i>in compressed form</i> both in memory
    and on disk. When sending the document back to the client, Couchbase Server
    sends the document in compressed form, if this is required by the client.  
   </p>
   
   <p>
    On receipt of an uncompressed document, Couchbase Server does not
    compress it for storage in memory. Such documents are compressed for
    storage on disk, and are sent back to clients in uncompressed form.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Replication within the cluster uses a compression-enabled DCP stream.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    This mode is assigned by default to <i>new</i> buckets, in post-5.0
    versions of Couchbase Server.
   </p>
   
  </section>
  
  <section>
   
   <title>
    Data-Compression Mode: Active
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Couchbase Server actively compresses documents for storage in memory
    and on disk, even if the documents are been received in a compressed format. 
    Documents are decompressed before being sent back to clients that do not
    participate in exchanges of compressed data.

    Enabling Data Compression
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Couchbase Server allows compression to be enabled by means of the following.
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    
    <li>
     The Couchbase Web Console, which allows buckets to be configured and updated.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     The Couchbase CLI, which allows buckets to be configured and updated.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     The <codeph>cbbackup</codeph>, <codeph>cbrestore</codeph>, and associated tools, which allow
     compressed documents to be requested in the backup stream.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     The Couchbase SDK, which can elect to send and receive compressed documents.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     <i>Cross Data-Center Replication</i> (XDCR), which can be configured to use
     data-compression end-to-end.
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>

   </ul>

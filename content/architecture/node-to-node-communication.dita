 <title>Node to node communication</title>
 <shortdesc>Nodes of the cluster communicate with each other to replicate data, maintain indexes, check health of nodes, communicate changes to the configuration of the cluster, and much more. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Node to node communication is optimized for high efficiency operations and may not go through all the connectivity phases (Authentication, Discovery, and Service connection). For more information about connectivity phases, see <xref href="client-to-cluster-communication.dita">Client to cluster communication</xref>. </p>

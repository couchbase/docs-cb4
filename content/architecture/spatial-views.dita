 <title>Spatial views</title>
 <shortdesc>Spatial views are indexed in a similar way as the incremental MapReduce view indexes.
  However, spatial views build an R-tree that enables processing of geographic data with
  multidimensional bounding box type queries. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The architectures of spatial and MapReduce views are similar. See <xref
        href="incremental-map-reduce-views.dita">Incremental MapReduce views</xref> for details
      about the architecture.</p>

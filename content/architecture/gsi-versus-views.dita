 <title>Global Secondary Indexes Versus Views</title>
 <shortdesc>There are a number of differences between views and GSIs. At a high level, GSIs are built for N1QL queries, which are great for supporting interactive applications that require fast response times. Views, on the other hand, provide sophisticated user defined functions to provide great flexibility in indexing. Views can support complex interactive reporting queries with a precalculated result.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p> <note>N1QL can utilize both GSIs and Views. However, N1QL only utilizes a
    subset of view capabilities. N1QL does not support user defined MapReduce definitions and restricts the definitions to a subset of capabilities only available through the CREATE INDEX statement. </note></p>
  <p>The following table lists the key differences between GSIs and Views. <table frame="all"

        capabilities, you (as an administrator) can choose to deploy indexes on hardware that is tuned for indexing.</entry>

       <entry>Performance characteristics</entry>
       <entry>N1QL queries that require singleton lookups or range scans can process scans on GSI without scatter-gather operations if the relevant indexes are available for the
        query.</entry>
       <entry>Views are partitioned based on data distribution and document keys, thus requiring scatter-gather operations for the same type of queries. Network based processing can be more expensive than local in-memory processing because scatter-gather operations are  generally much slower. As the node count of the cluster increases, views require a wider fan-out and hence a more network based processing.</entry>

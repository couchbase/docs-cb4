    Overview
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Bucket TTL is a non-negative integer-value, specified per bucket, that determines the maximum expiration times
    of individual documents: if Bucket TTL is enabled, each newly created
    document lives for the number of seconds specified by Bucket TTL, following the document's creation. When its 
    expiration time is reached, the document 
    is marked for deletion. Deleted documents and their contents are no longer available: access-attempts are treated
    as if the documents never existed.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The maximum value for Bucket TTL is MAX32INT seconds (2147483648, or 68.096 years). The default value is 0, which 
    indicates that Bucket TTL is disabled. If Bucket TTL is changed from the default, it is thereby enabled. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Whenever Bucket TTL is modified, documents that existed <i>prior</i> to the modification:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Remain subject to the previous Bucket TTL, if Bucket TTL was previously enabled.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
     
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Remain subject to no Bucket TTL, if Bucket TTL was not previously enabled. 
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    
    </li>
    
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    Documents created or modified <i>following</i> the modification of Bucket TTL are subject to the modified Bucket TTL.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Bucket TTL can be established on Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets. It cannot be established on
    Memcached buckets. Note that Bucket TTL is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server.

    Expiration: Bucket versus Document

   <p>
    As described in the <i>Expiration Overview</i> section of
    <xref href="../sdk/core-operations.dita#devguide_kvcore_generic/expiry" scope="local" format="dita">Core Operations</xref>,
    an expiration time can be specified per document, by means of Couchbase SDK APIs: this is referred 
    to as the document’s TTL. If a new document’s TTL is specified to be:
    
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Above that of Bucket TTL, the document's TTL is reduced to the value of Bucket TTL.
    
     <p>
     
     </p>
    
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Below that of Bucket TTL, the document's TTL is left unchanged.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
     
    </li>
    
    <li>
     0, the document's TTL is reset to the value of Bucket TTL.

    Bucket TTL Use Cases
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Bucket TTL is intended for use with buckets containing data that either must or can be permitted to expire after
    a certain period of time. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Bucket TTL <i>must not</i> be used with buckets whose data is required not to expire: for example, the buckets
    that support Couchbase Eventing and Couchbase Mobile. If Bucket TTL is used with such buckets, system failures 
    may result.

    Post-Expiration Purging
   </title>
   
   <p>
    When its expiration time is reached, a document is marked for deletion, and is deleted on the next
    access-attempt.
    As described in 
    <xref href="./core-data-access-bucket-disk-storage.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Bucket Disk Storage</xref>,
    for each document that is deleted, a tombstone, which includes key and metadata, continues to be maintained by 
    Couchbase Server for some period of time, as a record: this applies to all instances of document-deletion, 
    including those achieved by specifying Bucket TTL. To ensure that no trace of deleted documents remains, 
    tombstones are
    removed through a <i>Metadata Purge</i>.
    This is an automatic, non-disruptive background-process, which can be scheduled if necessary by means of
    Couchbase Web Console; as described in
    <xref href="../settings/configure-compact-settings.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Configuring Auto-Compaction</xref>.
    Note that the console allows the intervals between purges to be established as appropriately low, so
    that tombstones are removed promptly.

    Bucket-Expiration and XDCR
   </title>
   
   <p>
    When Cross Data-Center Replication occurs, the Bucket TTL setting does not get propagated from the source bucket 
    to the target. However, documents within the source bucket that have individual expiration times, including ones 
    derived from the source Bucket TTL setting, are replicated to the target along with their individual expiration times. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Buckets in the target cluster can have their own Bucket TTL settings, which may differ from those 
    of the buckets in the source. If, on the target cluster, the TTL of a replicated document is: 
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     Above that of Bucket TTL, the document's TTL is reduced to the value of Bucket TTL.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Below that of Bucket TTL, the document's TTL is left unchanged.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
     
    </li>
    
    <li>
     0, the document's TTL is reset to the value of Bucket TTL.
     
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    Note that in cases where the TTL of the replicated document is above that of Bucket TTL or is 0, if bi-directional 
    XDCR has been set up, the TTL of the document at the source is
    eventually also either reduced or reset to the value of the target's Bucket TTL.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Note also that when a document is replicated by XDCR, its expiration time is communicated to the target as absolute. 
    This requires that the system clocks of the respective clusters be fully synchronized; otherwise, inconsistent 
    behavior may result (as, for example, in the case where a document arrives at the target-cluster with an absolute 
    expiration time that is earlier than the current time acknowledged by the target-cluster). See

   Bucket Expiration

   Bucket Time To Live (TTL) can be user-specified per bucket, in order to define the expiration time for each document.

     Overview
    </title>
   
   <p>
    Bucket TTL is a value, specified per bucket, that determines each document’s expiration time: once created, a 
    document lives for the number of seconds specified by Bucket TTL. When the expiration time is reached, the document 
    is marked for deletion, and is deleted on the next access-attempt. Deleted documents and their contents no longer 
    appear in the results of queries or in views.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The maximum value for Bucket TTL is MAX32INT seconds (2147483648, or 68.096 years). The default value is 0, which 
    indicates that no expiration time is applied. If an expiration time is modified, documents that existed prior to 
    the modification remain subject to the previous 
    expiration time, rather than to the modified expiration time. New documents are subject to 
    the modified expiration time.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Note that Bucket TTL is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server.

     Expiration: Bucket versus Document

   <p>
    As described in the <i>Expiration Overview</i> section of
    <xref href="../sdk/core-operations.dita#devguide_kvcore_generic/expiry" scope="local" format="dita">Core Operations</xref>,
    an expiration time can be specified per document, by means of Couchbase SDK APIs: this is referred 
    to as the document’s TTL. If a document’s TTL is specified to be above Bucket TTL, the TTL is 
    capped to the level of Bucket TTL.

      As described in 
      <xref href="./core-data-access-bucket-disk-storage.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Bucket Disk Storage</xref>,
      for each document that is deleted, a tombstone, which includes key and metadata, continues to be maintained by 
      Couchbase Server for some period of time, as a record: this applies to all instances of document-deletion, 
      including those achieved by specifying Bucket TTL. To ensure that no trace of deleted documents remains, 
      tombstones should themselves be explicitly 
      removed through a Metadata Purge: this can be scheduled by means of the Couchbase Web Console, as described in
      <xref href="../settings/configure-compact-settings.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Configuring Auto-Compaction</xref>.
      Note that the console allows the interval between purges to be established as low, in order to
      ensure prompt tombstone removal.

     Bucket-Expiration and XDCR
    </title>
    
    <p>
     When Cross Data-Center Replication occurs, the Bucket TTL setting does not get propagated from the source bucket 
     to the target. However, documents within the source bucket that have individual expiration times, including ones 
     derived from the source Bucket TTL setting, are replicated to the target along with their individual expiration times. 
    </p>
     
    <p>
     Buckets in the target cluster can have their own Bucket TTL settings, which may not correspond to those 
     of the buckets in the source. If the expiration time of a replicated document is, on the target cluster, above 
     that of Bucket TTL, the document’s TTL is capped to the level of Bucket TTL.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Note that when a document is replicated by XDCR, its expiration time is communicated to the target as absolute. 
     This requires that the system clocks of the respective clusters be fully synchronized; otherwise, inconsistent 
     behavior may result (as, for example, in the case where a document arrives at the target-cluster with an absolute 
     expiration time that is earlier than the current time acknowledged by the target-cluster). See

     If <i>auditing</i> is switched on, changes to each bucket's expiration time are
     recorded, and can be subsequently viewed. See

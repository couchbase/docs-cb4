 <title>Monitoring Statistics</title>
 <shortdesc>Within the <uicontrol>Data Bucket</uicontrol> tab, information and statistics about
  buckets and nodes is displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster. The information is
  aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected
  bucket.</shortdesc>
 <body>
  <p>The following functionality is available through this display, and is common to all the graphs
   and statistics display within the web console.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Bucket Selection</b> - The <b>Data Buckets</b> selection list lets you select which of the
    buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph display. The
    statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected bucket.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Server Selection</b> - The <b>Server Selection</b> option enables you to limit the display
    to an individual server or entire cluster. The individual node selection displays information
    for the node. The all server nodes selection displays information for the entire cluster.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Interval Selection</b> - The <b>Interval Selection</b> at the top of the main graph
    changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page. For example, selecting
     <codeph>Minute</codeph> shows information for the last minute, continuously updating. As the
    selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long
    your cluster has been running.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Statistic Selection</b> - All of the graphs within the display update simultaneously.
    Clicking on any of the smaller graphs will promote that graph to be displayed as the main graph
    for the page.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Individual Server Selection</b> - Clicking the blue triangle next to any of the smaller
    statistics graphs enables you to show the selected statistic individual for each server within
    the cluster, instead of aggregating the information for the entire cluster.</li>
  </ul>

   </table><p>The <b>Status</b> column indicates the current state of the replication configuration.
    The status options include:</p><ul>
    <li><b>Starting Up</b> - The replication process has just started, and the clusters are
     determining what data needs to be sent from the originating cluster to the destination
     cluster.</li>
   </ul><ul>
    <li><b>Replicating</b> - The bucket is currently being replicated and changes to the data stored
     on the originating cluster are being sent to the destination cluster.</li>
   </ul><ul>
    <li><b>Failed</b> - Replication to the destination cluster has failed. The destination cluster
     cannot be reached. The replication configuration may need to be deleted and recreated.</li>
   </ul><p>Under the <b>Data Buckets</b> tab, you can click on a named Couchbase bucket and find
    more statistics about replication for that bucket. Couchbase Web Console displays statistics for
    the particular bucket; on this page you can find two drop-down areas: <b>Outgoing XDCR</b> and
     <b>Incoming XDCR Operations</b>. Both provides statistics about ongoing replication for the
    particular bucket. Under the<b>Outgoing XDCR</b> panel if you have multiple replication streams
    you will see statistics for each stream.</p>

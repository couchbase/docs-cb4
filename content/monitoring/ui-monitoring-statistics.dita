 <shortdesc>From the <uicontrol>Data Bucket</uicontrol> menu, information and statistics about
  buckets and nodes is displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster. The information is
  aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected
  bucket.</shortdesc>
 <body>

  <p>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > Buckets</uicontrol> menu, click the
    <uicontrol>Statistics</uicontrol> link for each bucket. Each bucket page shows different graphs
   and statistics as explained below:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Bucket Selection</b> - The <uicontrol>Buckets</uicontrol> selection list lets you select
    which of the buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph
    display. The statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected
    bucket.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Server Selection</b> - The <uicontrol>All Server Nodes</uicontrol> selection option
    enables you to limit the display to an individual server or entire cluster. The individual node
    selection displays information for the node. The all server nodes selection displays information
    for the entire cluster.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Interval Selection</b> - The <uicontrol>Interval</uicontrol> selection at the top of the
    main graph changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page. For example, selecting
     <uicontrol>Minute</uicontrol> shows information for the last minute, continuously
     updating.<p>As the selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will
     depend on how long your cluster has been running.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Statistic Selection</b> - All of the graphs within the display update simultaneously.
    Clicking on any of the smaller graphs will promote that graph to be displayed as the main graph
    for the page. </li>
  </ul>

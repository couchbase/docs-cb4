    Managing XDCR
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Cross Data-Center Replication can be managed by means of the Couchbase Web Console, the 
    Couchbase CLI, and the Couchbase REST API.
  </shortdesc>
  
  <body>
    
    <p>
      If you possess the role of Full, Cluster, or Replication Administrator, you can create, edit, and delete cluster references
      and replications from the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > XDCR</uicontrol> menu. As replication 
      is on a per bucket basis, you must configure replication for each
      bucket individually, to each target cluster. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Before configuring XDCR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure all nodes within each cluster to communicate from the source cluster over the
        network to all nodes on the destination cluster.</li>
      <li>Ensure that all Couchbase Server platforms match. For instance, if you want to replicate
        from a Linux-based cluster, you need to do so with another Linux-based cluster.</li>
      <li>Confirm that your cluster is properly sized and is able to handle new XDCR streams. For
        example, XDCR needs 1-2 additional CPU cores per stream and in some cases it will require
        more RAM and network resources as well. If a cluster is not properly sized for the existing
        workload plus the new XDCR streams, XDCR can compete for server resources and have a
        negative impact on overall performances.</li>
      <li>Couchbase Server uses TCP/IP port <codeph>8091</codeph> to exchange cluster configuration
        information. If you are communicating with a destination cluster over a dedicated connection
        or the Internet, you should ensure that all the nodes in the destination and source clusters
        can communicate with each other over ports <codeph>8091</codeph> and
        <codeph>8092</codeph>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From the <uicontrol>XDCR</uicontrol> menu, you can configure <uicontrol>Remote
        Clusters</uicontrol> for XDCR; these are named destination clusters you can select when you
      configure replication. When you configure XDCR, the destination cluster reference should point
      to the IP address of one of the nodes in the destination cluster. Once it has the connection
      with that one node, similar to how a Couchbase SDK does, it will receive the cluster topology
      of that destination cluster.</p>
    <p><uicontrol>Ongoing Replications</uicontrol> are the ones that are configured and operating
      currently. You can monitor the current configuration, current status, and the last time a
      replication process was triggered for each configured replication.</p>

    <section><title>Create a Remote Cluster Reference</title>
      <p>The cluster reference sets the cluster name, IP or hostname, and administrator credentials. </p>

                    <codeblock>Number of concurrent workers writing to the target cluster  =

                    more mutations per second are received by XDCR than it can send to the target
                    node. This can lead to mutations piling up in the XDCR queue and to DCP backing

                <entry>The Checkpoint Interval does not affect the persistence of actual data.
                  During that time, XDCR computes and persists checkpoint documents, which contain
                  the high sequence number for each vBucket that was successfully replicated to the
                  target cluster. <p>If the replication is restarted by user or recovers from an
                    error, the checkpoint documents can be used to determine the starting point of
                    the replication to avoid unnecessary work. The shorter the interval, the more
                    accurate the checkpoint documents will be and the less unnecessary work will be
                    needed at the replication restart. The computation and persistence of checkpoint
                    documents use considerable system resources and may impact XDCR performance if
                    they are performed too frequently. A tradeoff is needed to determine the optimal
                    value for the users.</p></entry>

      <p>Full, Cluster, and Replication Administrators can set up filtering in XDCR.</p>
      <p>The <varname>filtering expression</varname> is a regular expression for filtering keys that
        need to be transmitted from the source cluster to the destination cluster. It is set when

      <note type="important">Filtering expressions are currently implemented only for the document
        keys.</note>
      <p>If you need to replicate to the same destination cluster and bucket with different

        multiple expressions ORed together as: <codeph>filterExpression0|filterExpression1</codeph>. </p>
      <p>For example, the expression <codeph>airline|hotel</codeph> would match both "unitedairline"

      <note type="important">You cannot change a filtering expression on an existing
        replication.</note>
      <p>It is important to avoid conditions where two replications to the same destination overlap
        partially or fully. If an overlap occurs, it will waste machine resources since a single key
        gets replicated multiple times. Overlapping filtering expressions cannot guarantee which of
        the two replications will replicate the overlapping key instance to the destination faster. </p>
      <p>Filtering does not impact conflict resolution and can be used with a conflict
        resolution based on revision ID (RevID). </p>
      
      <p>You can pause or resume replication with filtering expression without restrictions. </p>
      <p><b>Test a Replication Filter</b></p>
      <p>For example, if you have installed the
        <codeph>Travel-Sample</codeph> bucket and want to replicate a subset of data to a remote
        cluster, use the regular expression provided below to test it out:
        <codeblock>regular exp - airline* 
          test key -airline_SFO</codeblock></p>
      <p><b>XDCR Filtering Regular Expression</b></p>
      <p>This is a list of JavaScript regular expressions (RegEx) you can use for XDCR
        filtering.</p>
      <p>Regular expressions (RegEx) are a powerful way to match a sequence of simple characters. You
        can use regular expressions to create filters. </p>
      <p>Regular expressions are case-sensitive: a lowercase 
        &apos;<codeph>a</codeph>&apos; is distinct from an
        uppercase &apos;<codeph>A</codeph>&apos;. You can enclose a range of characters in square brackets to match
        against all of those characters.</p>

        <li>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > XDCR > Ongoing Replications</uicontrol>

      <p>Full, Cluster, Read-only, and Replication Administrators can monitor the replication
        status using the <wintitle>XDCR</wintitle> and <wintitle>Data Buckets</wintitle>
        tabs.</p>
      <p>The following Couchbase Web Console areas contain information about replication via XDCR:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <uicontrol>XDCR > Replication</uicontrol> page.</li>
        <li>The <uicontrol>Data Buckets > Outgoing XDCR</uicontrol> Statistics section. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Couchbase Web Console displays any replications configured, or replications in progress for
        that particular source cluster. If you want to view information about replications at a
        destination cluster, you must open the console for that cluster. When configuring
        bi-directional replication, use the web interfaces that belong to the source and destination
        clusters to monitor both clusters. </p>
      <p>Any errors that occur during replication appear in the XDCR errors panel. 
        The following example shows the errors that occur if replication streams from XDCR fail due to the missing vBuckets at the source cluster:
      </p>
      <p><image href="picts/xdcr-replication-statuis.png" id="image_tfl_mg5_zs" align="left"
        width="450"/></p>
      <p><b>XDCR Replication and Network Failures</b></p>
      <p>XDCR is resilient to intermittent network failures. If the destination cluster is unavailable due to a network interruption, XDCR pauses 
        replication and then retries the connection to the cluster every 30 seconds. Once XDCR can successfully reconnect with the 
        destination cluster, it resumes replication.</p>
      <p>In the event of a more prolonged network failure, where the destination cluster is unavailable for more than 30 seconds, 
        the source cluster continues to poll the destination cluster possibly resulting in numerous errors over time.</p>

  <title>Tune XDCR Performance</title>
  <body>
    <p>Full, Cluster, and Replication Administrators can adjust the advanced settings to tune the
      XDCR performance.</p>
      
    <p>By default, XDCR gets metadata for documents over 256 bytes twice before it performs
      conflict resolution for them at a destination cluster. If the document fails conflict
      resolution, it is discarded at the destination cluster. If a document is smaller than the
      number of bytes provided with this parameter (256 bytes), XDCR immediately puts it into the
      replication queue without getting metadata on the source cluster.</p>
      
      <p>If the document is deleted on the source cluster, XDCR will no longer fetch metadata for this document before it sends the update to the 
      destination cluster. Once the document reaches the destination cluster, XDCR will fetch the metadata and perform conflict resolution between documents. 
      If the document ‘loses’ conflict resolution, Couchbase Server discards it on the destination cluster and keeps the version on the destination. 
      This new feature improves replication latency, particularly when you replicate small documents.</p>
      
      <p>There are tradeoffs when you change this setting. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you set the optimistic replication threshold low compared to the document size, the
        source cluster will have to frequently check the metadata of the document on the remote
        cluster. This means that latency increases during replication as the source cluster also has
        to fetch the metadata prior to (possibly) adding the document to the replication queue. The
        advantage is that you do not use unneccessary network bandwidth in situations where the
        remote cluster already has the same copy of the document.</li>
      <li>If you configure this setting very high relative to the document size, XDCR fetches less
        metadata and latency will improve during replication. High setting also means that you will
        increase the rate at which XDCR puts items immediately into the replication queue; this can
        potentially overwhelm your network, especially if you set a high number of parallel
        replicators. The number of documents sent by XDCR, therefore, might be increased, and
        network bandwidth misused.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The following advanced settings are related to XDCR performance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><codeph>optimisticReplicationThreshold</codeph></li>
      <li><codeph>sourceNozzlePerNode</codeph>
        </li>
        <li><codeph>targetNozzlePerNode</codeph></li>
    </ul>
    <note type="note">XDCR does not fetch metadata for the deleted documents.</note>
    <section><title>Changing the Document Threshold</title>
      <p>Change the document threshold with the REST URI
        <codeblock>/settings/replications optimisticReplicationThreshold </codeblock>and the
        parameter for XDCR advanced settings. Alternatively, change the XDCR <codeph>Optimistic
          Replication Threshold </codeph>setting for the XDCR replication. </p>

    </section>
    <section><title>Replication Statistics</title>
      <p>The provided statistics is <codeph>docs_ fail_ cr_source,</codeph> which is the number of
        big documents that have failed conflict resolution on the source and have not been
        replicated to the target cluster. </p>
      
      
    </section>
    <section><title>Bucket Flush with XDCR</title>
      <p>The flush operation deletes data on a local bucket.</p>
      <p>XDCR does not replicate flush requests to delete the entire content of the Couchbase bucket.
        The flush option is disabled if an active outbound replica stream is configured.</p>
      
      <p> If the Couchbase bucket needs to be flushed either on the source or on the destination of
        an XDCR replication, use the following operation sequence: <ol>
          <li>Delete the XDCR replication.</li>
          <li>Flush the Couchbase bucket.</li>
          <li> Recreate the XDCR replication.</li>
        </ol></p>
      
      <p>If the Couchbase bucket needs to be flushed on the source side of an XDCR replication, all replications must be deleted before the flush and recreated afterward.</p>
      
      <p> Deleting and recreating the XDCR replication will reset the replication and resend the data, unless the data has been synchronized.</p>
      
      <note type="important"> When replicating to or from the Couchbase bucket, do not flush that
        bucket on the source or destination cluster. Flushing causes the Couchbase bucket's state to
        become temporarily inaccessible and results in a <codeph>not_found </codeph>error. This error
        suspends replication. </note>

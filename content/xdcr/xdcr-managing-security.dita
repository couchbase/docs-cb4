        Overview
      </title>
      
      <p>
        By default, XDCR passes credentials and data in unencrypted form. Optionally, TLS can
        be enabled, for the sending either of password alone, or of both password and data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note that
        if the password received by the destination cluster requires authentication by an LDAP server, the destination
        cluster communicates with the LDAP server in plain text, using <codeph>saslauthd</codeph>. This is described in
        <xref href="../security/security-saslauthd-new.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Setting Up saslauthd</xref>.

        Enabling a Secure Connection
      </title> 
     
      <p>
        Optionally, encryption can be applied per replication, by means of TLS.
        See
        <xref href="../security/security-authorization.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Authorization</xref>
        for details on the <i>roles</i> that permit this activity. Then, proceed as follows:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          On the destination cluster, navigate to 
          
          <menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Root Certificate</uicontrol>
          </menucascade>,
          
          and copy the certificate. 
          
          <p>
            
          </p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
          On the source cluster, left-click on the <b>XDCR</b> tab. This brings up 
          the <uicontrol>XDCR Replications</uicontrol> screen.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Do one of the following:
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              To create a new cluster-reference, in the <uicontrol>Remote Clusters</uicontrol> panel, 
              left-click on the <uicontrol>Add Remote Cluster</uicontrol> button, to the right. This 
              brings up the <uicontrol>Add Remote Cluster</uicontrol> dialog.
              
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              To edit an existing cluster-reference, in the <uicontrol>Remote Clusters</uicontrol> panel,
              left-click on the <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> tab, at the right of the row of an 
              existing cluster-reference. This brings up
              the <uicontrol>Edit Remote Cluster</uicontrol> dialog.
              
              <p>
                
              </p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          In the dialog you have brought up, enter appropriate information for the <b>Cluster Name</b>, <b>IP/Hostname</b>,
          <b>Username for Remote Cluster</b>, and <b>Password</b> (note that the username and password must
          be those either of the Full or the Cluster Administrator for the destination cluster). Then,
          check the <uicontrol>Enable Secure Connection</uicontrol> checkbox. When the dialog expands vertically, select one
          of the following encryption-options:
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Half</b>, which enables TLS password encryption only.
              
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <b>Full</b>, which enables TLS password and data encryption.
              
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          Paste the copied certificate into
          the pane at the bottom of the dialog. The appearance of the dialog is now approximately
          as follows: 

            <image href="./picts/editRemoteClusterDialog.png" id="edit_remote_cluster" width="360" />
          
          
          <p>
            Left-click on the <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> button. 
          </p>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          If you are adding a new cluster-reference, 
          in the <b>Ongoing Replications</b> panel, click <uicontrol>Add Replication</uicontrol>, 
          provide the cluster and bucket information, and click <uicontrol>Replicate</uicontrol>. This starts
          replication.
          
          <p>
            Alternatively, if you are editing an existing replication, you do not have to take any further action: the existing
            replication automatically restarts, with
            TLS enabled. During restart, XDCR uses the last checkpoint of the replication stream.
          </p>
        </li>
        
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Note that it is good practice  
        periodically to rotate XDCR certificates, and instantiate new ones.

        XDCR Security Error-Messages
      </title>
      
      <p>
        When creating the cluster reference, if certificates on the destination and source 
        clusters are mismatched, the following error message is displayed: <codeph>Attention - Got certificate mismatch while trying to send https 
          request to HOST:18091</codeph>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If XDCR is underway, and stops due to a certificate mismatch, the following error message is displayed:
        <codeph>Error replicating vbucket &lt;</codeph><i>bucketNumber</i><codeph>&gt;. Please see logs for details.</codeph>

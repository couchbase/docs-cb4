        Overview
      </title>
      
      <p>
        By default, for inter-cluster communications, XDCR transmits both password and data in non-secure form. 
        Optionally, a secure connection
        can be enabled between clusters, in order to secure either password alone, or both password and data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note that
        if the password received by the destination cluster requires authentication by an LDAP server, the destination
        cluster communicates with the LDAP server in plain text, using <codeph>saslauthd</codeph>. This is described in
        <xref href="../security/security-saslauthd-new.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Setting Up saslauthd</xref>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A secure XDCR connection is enabled either by SCRAM-SHA or by TLS &#8212; depending on the 
        administrator-specified connection-type,
        and the server-version of the destination cluster.
        Use of TLS involves certificate management: for
        information on preparing and using certificates, see
        <xref href="../security/security-certs-auth.dita" format="dita" scope="local">Certificate-Based Authentication</xref>.

      <p>
        Proceed as follows:
      </p>
      
      <ol>

        <li>
          On the source cluster, left-click on the <b>XDCR</b> tab. This brings up 
          the <uicontrol>XDCR Replications</uicontrol> screen.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Do one of the following:
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              To create a new cluster-reference, in the <uicontrol>Remote Clusters</uicontrol> panel, 
              left-click on the <uicontrol>Add Remote Cluster</uicontrol> button, to the right. This 
              brings up the <uicontrol>Add Remote Cluster</uicontrol> dialog.
              
              <p>
                
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              To edit an existing cluster-reference, in the <uicontrol>Remote Clusters</uicontrol> panel,
              left-click on the <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> tab, at the right of the row of an 
              existing cluster-reference. This brings up
              the <uicontrol>Edit Remote Cluster</uicontrol> dialog.
              
              <p>
                
              </p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          
          In the dialog you have brought up, enter appropriate information for the <b>Cluster Name</b> and <b>IP/Hostname</b>.
          Then, proceed as appropriate for the type of connection you wish to establish, according to the instructions below.
          Note that in each example, the username and password specified must be those
          of the Full, Cluster, or XDCR Administrator for the destination cluster.

            In the open <b>Add</b> or <b>Edit</b> dialog, enter the

        Enable a 'Half' Secure Connection
      </title>
          
      <p>
        A <i>Half</i> secure connection secures the specified password only: it does not secure data. The
        password is secured:
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>
          By hashing with SCRAM-SHA, when the destination cluster is running Couchbase Enterprise Server 5.5 or later.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          By TLS encryption, when the destination cluster is running a pre-5.5 Couchbase Enterprise Server.
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The root certificate of the destination cluster must be provided, for a successful TLS connection to
        be achieved. If this certificate is provided and a SCRAM-SHA connection is achieved, the certificate
        is ignored. The root certificate can be obtained by accessing the <b>Root Certificate</b> tab, on the
        <b>Security</b> screen for the remote cluster: copy the certificate from the interactive panel in which
        it appears.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To enable a secure <i>half</i> connection with a destination cluster
        that may be either pre-5.0 or 5.0 and beyond,
        proceed as follows:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the open <b>Add</b> or <b>Edit</b> dialog, enter the 
          <b>Username for Remote Cluster</b>, and <b>Password</b>. 
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Check the <b>Enable Secure Connection</b> checkbox. When the dialog expands vertically, select
          the <b>Half</b> radio button. 
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Copy and paste the root certificate for the destination cluster into the interactive panel, below
          the radio buttons. The dialog now appears approximately as follows:

          </p>
          
        </li>

      <p>
        A <i>Full</i> secure connection handles both authentication and data-transfer via
        TLS. Select the
        <b>Full</b> radio-button. When the dialog expands vertically to reveal two additional interactive panes, proceed in
        one of the following ways, as appropriate.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>

              Copy and paste the root certificate for the destination cluster into the top interactive pane, below
              the radio buttons &#8212; leaving both of the lower interactive panes blank. The dialog now appears
              approximately as follows:

        <li>
          Specify root and client certificates, and client private key.
          
          <p>
            General information on preparing client certificates and keys is
            provided in
            <xref href="../security/security-x509certsintro.dita" scope="local" format="dita">X.509 for TLS</xref>.

            Note that if the client certificate has been generated using the root certificate, the client certificate itself
            must be specified. Alternatively, if the client certificate has been generated using intermediate certificates, the
            entire certificate chain &#8212; including the client certificate and all intermediate certificates &#8212; must
            be specified.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Proceed as follows:
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            
            <li>

            <li>
              Copy and paste the client certificate for the local cluster into the middle interactive pane.

        Starting Replication
      </title>
        
        <p>
          If you are adding a new cluster-reference, 
          in the <b>Ongoing Replications</b> panel, click <uicontrol>Add Replication</uicontrol>, 
          provide the cluster and bucket information, and click <uicontrol>Replicate</uicontrol>. This starts
          replication.
          
        </p>
          
          <p>
            Alternatively, if you are editing an existing replication, you do not have to take any further action: the existing
            replication automatically restarts, with
            TLS enabled. During restart, XDCR uses the last checkpoint of the replication stream.
          </p>
 
      
      <p>
        Note that it is good practice  
        periodically to rotate XDCR certificates, and instantiate new ones.

      <p>
        When creating the cluster reference, if certificates on the destination and source 
        clusters are mismatched, the following error message is displayed: <codeph>Attention - Got certificate mismatch while trying to send https

  <title>Replication for views</title>
  <shortdesc>XDCR does not replicate views and view indexes.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>To replicate views and view indexes, manually exchange view definitions between clusters and
      regenerate the index on the destination cluster.</p>
    <p>Non-UTF–8 encodable document IDs on the source cluster are automatically filtered out and
      logged. The IDs are not transferred to the remote cluster.</p> 
      
      <p>If there are any non-UTF–8 keys, the warning output,
        <systemoutput>xdcr_error.*</systemoutput> displays in the log files along with a list of all
      non-UTF–8 keys found by XDCR.</p>

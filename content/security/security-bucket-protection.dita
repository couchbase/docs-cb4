    Bucket Protection
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Couchbase Server secures buckets by means of <i>Role-Based Access
    Control</i> (RBAC): thereby ensuring that for production-purposes, all buckets
    can be password-protected; with different access-privileges assigned
    to different users.

        Bucket Access
      </title> 
      
      <p>
        To access cluster-resoures, Couchbase Server <i>users</i> &#8212; administrators 
        and applications &#8212; must
        specify a <i>username</i> and <i>password</i>. Each user, when defined
        by a <i>Full Administrator</i> (who has read-write permission on all features
        of the cluster), is assigned one or more <i>roles</i>; which
        determine either <i>read</i> or <i>read-write</i> access to 
        server-resources. When a user successfully authenticates, their roles
        are examined by Couchbase Server; if the assigned roles correspond to
        appropriate privileges, the user is granted a certain level
        of access to the resource. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Couchbase <i>buckets</i> are among the resources protected by RBAC.

        buckets, see

        Removal of Unprotected Buckets
      </title>
      
      <p>
        For production-purposes,
        all buckets must be RBAC-protected, as described
        above. Any additional, legacy buckets, created non-securely, should be
        removed: this applies to legacy <i>default</i> and <i>sample</i> buckets
        that were created without password-protection.

    Auditing
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Actions performed on Couchbase Server can be <i>audited</i>. This allows a full
    administrator to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately
    performed. This potentially facilitates compliance with regulatory standards.

        Audit Records and their Content
      </title>
    
      <p>
        The records created by the Couchbase Auditing facililty capture information on
        <i>who</i> has performed <i>what</i> action, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> successfully:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Who</i>: The administrator performing actions. To access the system, each
          administrator has authenticated, either locally or by means of LDAP: and is therefore
          identifiable throughout their session.
        
          <p>
           <!-- Vertical space -->
          </p>
      
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <i>What</i>: The action performed. 30 different kinds of action are tracked by Couchbase Server.
        
          <p>
            <!-- Vertical space -->
          </p>
      
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <i>When</i>: The UTC time stamp that corresponds to each recorded action.
      
          <p>
            <!-- Vertical space -->
          </p>
        
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <i>How</i>: The success or failure of the action. 
      
          <p>
            <!-- Vertical space -->
          </p>
        
          </li>
      
        </ul>
 
      <p>
        Audit records are created by Couchbase Server-processes, which run asynchronously. Each
        record is stored as a JSON file,
        which can be retrieved and inspected.

          Audit Configuration
        </title>
        
        <p>
          Only a <i>Full Administrator</i> can configure auditing. Configuration is performed by 
          means of the Couchbase Web Console. Proceed as follows.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Access the Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> tab,
          in the vertical navigation-bar, at the left-hand side of the Dashboard:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/securityTabWithHandCursor.png" id="security-tab-with-hand-cursor" align="left" width="110"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This brings up the <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> screen, which appears as follows:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/securityViewInitialNoUsers.png" id="security-view-initial-no-users" align="left" width="820"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The initial, default view is for <uicontrol>Users</uicontrol>. To select auditing, left-click on
          the <uicontrol>Audit</uicontrol> tab, on the horizontal control-bar, near the top:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/auditTab.png" id="audit-tab" align="left" width="140"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This brings up the <uicontrol>Audit</uicontrol> view:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/auditView.png" id="audit-view" align="left" width="820"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To enable auditing, check the <uicontrol>Enable Auditing</uicontrol> checkbox:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/enableAuditing.png" id="enable-auditing" align="left" width="100"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This makes the default pathname within the <uicontrol>Target Log Directory</uicontrol> text-field
          editable. If you wish to modify the pathname, enter the appropriate content. Records will be saved
          to the directory you specify. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The <uicontrol>Log Rotation Time Interval</uicontrol> determines how often stored log files &#8212; referred
          to as <i>targets</i> &#8212; are
          <i>rotated</i>: this means that the current default file, to which records are being written, named
          <codeph>audit.log</codeph> is
          saved under a new name, which features an appended timestamp. For example:
          <i>usermachinename</i><codeph>.local-2017-03-16T15-42-18-audit.log</codeph>.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          The number of units is specified
          by changing the number <codeph>1</codeph>, which appears in the interactive field by default. The
          unit-type is specified by means of the pull-down menu, at the right-hand side of the field:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <image href="pict/setRotationTimeInterval.png" id="set-rotation-time-interval" align="left" width="230"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Note that the value you establish must be in the range from 15 minutes to 7 days.
        </p>

      <section><title>Configuring with CLI</title>
        <p>The following CLI syntax is used to configure Couchbase auditing for administrators:</p>
        
        <codeblock>couchbase-cli 
          setting-audit  OPTIONS
          --audit-log-rotate-interval=[MINUTES]     //log rotation interval
          --audit-log-path=[PATH]                   //target log directory
          --audit-enabled=[0|1]                     //enable auditing or not</codeblock>

        Understanding Audit Events
      </title>
      
      <p>
        <i>Audit events</i> are defined by Couchbase, and are automatically generated when auditing is enabled, in correspondence with
        defined actions. 
        Corresponding data is written to target-files. For a complete list of events, see the section
        <xref href="./security-audit-events.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Audit Events</xref>.

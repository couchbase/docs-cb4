  Access a Bucket
 </title>
 
 <shortdesc>
  To access a bucket, administrators and applications must use the Couchbase <i>Role-Based Access Control</i> 
  system. This requires that appropriate credentials
  be passed, and the administrator or application thereby authorized, for access to be granted.

    Testing User-Access
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Using the Couchbase Web Console, you can set up buckets, create users, and assign
    users <i>roles</i> that allow them to access the buckets you have created. You can
    test the results by means of N1QL queries, executed by means of the <codeph>cbq</codeph>
    tool. You can do this in three stages:
   </p>
   
   <ol>
    
    <li>
     Create a bucket containing documents, different levels of access to which can be assigned to different
     users. This is described in the section
     <xref href="./security-create-bucket-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create and Populate a Bucket</xref>.

     </p>
    
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Create users with different role-combinations. See
     <xref href="./security-create-users-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create Users and Assign Roles</xref>.
     
     <p>
      <!-- Vertical space -->
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Use the <codeph>cbq</codeph> tool to test bucket-access, according to the roles you have assigned to users.

     Access cbq
    </title>
   
    <p>
     The <codeph>cbq</codeph> tool provides a command-line shell, whereby <i>N1QL</i> queries can be issued. See
     <xref href="../sdk/webui-cli-access.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Browser and CLI Access</xref>
     for details on the tool's location. See
     <xref href="../getting-started/try-a-query.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Run Your First N1QL Query</xref>
     for an introduction to using Nq1QL.

    Start and Manage a Reader-Session
   </title>
   
   <p>
    RBAC requires that programs and applications authenticate with appropriate credentials, just like users. When
    you start a <codeph>cbq</codeph> session therefore, you must specify the username and password for the user
    who has been granted roles appropriate for tasks you wish to perform. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    To start a <codeph>cbq</codeph> session for a reader of data, enter the following against the command-line prompt:
   </p>
   
   <codeblock outputclass="bourne">$ ./cbq -e http://localhost:8091 -u=composerReader -p=composerReader
Connected to : http://localhost:8091/. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.
    
Path to history file for the shell : /Users/tonyhillman/.cbq_history
cbq></codeblock>
   
   <p>
    The <codeph>cbq</codeph> prompt has now appeared, which means that you can enter N1QL queries for the user
    identified by the credential previously established for <codeph>composerReader</codeph>. Enter the
    follow N1QL query, to return all data from the <codeph>composers</codeph> bucket:
   </p>
   
   <codeblock outputclass="javascript">cbq> SELECT * FROM composers;</codeblock>
   
   <p>
    This returns the following:
   </p>
   
   <codeblock outputclass="javascript">{

            "code": 4000,
            "msg": "No index available on keyspace philosophers that matches your query. Use CREATE INDEX or CREATE PRIMARY INDEX to create an index, or check that your expected index is online."
        }
    ],

}</codeblock>   
   
   <p>
    An error has been returned, indicating that no index yet exists on the <codeph>composers</codeph> bucket. To create
    an index, enter the following N1QL statement:
   </p>
   
   <codeblock outputclass="javascript">cbq> CREATE PRIMARY INDEX composersIndex4 ON composers USING GSI;</codeblock>
   
   <p>
    The response to this index-creation directive is now as follows:
   </p>

    }
}</codeblock>
   
   <p>
    Another error has been returned, this time indicating that the current user <codeph>does not belong to
    a specified role</codeph>. This indicates that the role associated with the current user, that of
    read-access to data in the <codeph>composers</codeph> bucket, is insufficient to allow index-creation.
    Index-creation requires the <i>Query Manage Index</i> role, which you allocated to 
    <codeph>composerIndexMaker</codeph>.

    Exit the current <codeph>cbq</codeph> session by hiting <codeph>Ctrl-D</codeph>. Then, start a

   <codeblock outputclass="bourne">$ ./cbq -e http://localhost:8091 -u=composersIndexMaker -p=composersIndexMaker

   <p>
    Note that the credentials with which you have started this new session are those of the user who was assigned
    the <i>Query Manage Index</i> role.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Re-attempt to create an index on the <codeph>composers</codeph> bucket, and observe the response.
   </p>

    The response contains a <codeph>"status"</codeph> value of <codeph>"success"</codeph>. Therefore,

   <p>
    Again, an error is returned indicating that the user has the wrong role for the
    attempted operation. This is because the <codeph>UPDATE</codeph> operation requires
    read-write permission rather than read; and so must be performed by the previously
    defined <codeph>composersReaderWriter</codeph> user.
   </p>

    Again, exit the current <codeph>cbq</codeph> session by hitting <codeph>Ctrl-D</codeph>.

    As the output confirms, the correct credentials for the write-operation were supplied, and the specified data-value was
    therefore successfully updated.

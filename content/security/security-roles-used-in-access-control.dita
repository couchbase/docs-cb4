    Bucket Full Access
   </title>
   
   <p>
    The role <uicontrol>Bucket Full Access</uicontrol> is provided in support of
    buckets that were created on versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.0. Such buckets were
    accessed by specifying <i>bucket-name</i> and <i>bucket-password</i>: however, 
    bucket-passwords are not recognized by Couchbase Server 5.0 and after. Therefore,
    for each pre-existing bucket,
    the 5.0 upgrade-process creates a new user,
    whose username is identical to the bucket-name; and whose password
    is identical to the former bucket-password &#8212; this allows the same name-combination
    as before to be used in authentication. By default, each system-created user is 
    assigned the <uicontrol>Bucket Full Access</uicontrol> role, which authorizes the
    same read-write access to bucket-data as was granted before 5.0.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Use of the <uicontrol>Bucket Full Access</uicontrol> role is deprecated for buckets
    created on Couchbase Server 5.0 and after: use the other bucket-access roles provided.
   </p>
   
   <!-- Need to continue checking console-access for this role. Last time I tried, it was
        not possible to log in with the default username and password. Also, when I tried
        to edit the role, the password did not appear to have been set. I did managed to
        access from an application by specifying the username and password. So, the status
        is confusing, possible incomplete.

     Note that the <b>Query External Access</b> role should be assigned with caution, since
     it entails risk: CURL runs within the local Couchbase Server
     network; therefore, the assignee of the <b>Query External Access</b> 
     role is permitted
     to run GET and POST request on the internal network, while being themselves
     externally located.

   Security Best Practices
 </title>
  
 <shortdesc>
   Best practices should be observed at all times, in order
   to ensure the security of Couchbase Server itself, the media it uses for
   data-persistence, the internal and external
   networks on which it resides, and the applications that query it.

        Securing Couchbase Server
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Security must be enforced &#8212; in order to protect data from being stolen,
        eavesdropped upon, or corrupted &#8212; throughout the entire Couchbase 
        Server-environment: this includes the internal memory, processing, and
        storage-facilities of
        individual server-nodes within a cluster; the network across which the nodes
        communicate with one another; and
        the network beyond the cluster-perimeter. 
        Security procedures must be constantly checked; and should 
        be upgraded with frequency.

        On each node of the Couchbase Server-cluster, essential security measures include:

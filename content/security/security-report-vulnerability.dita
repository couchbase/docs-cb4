    Providing Information

   <ul>
    
    <li>A <i>CVSS</i> (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Score.

    Restricting Disclosure
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Couchbase, Inc. requests that you do not publicly disclose information regarding
    the reported vulnerability; until Couchbase has had the opportunity to analyze and 
    to respond to the report, and itself duly notify key users, customers, and
    partners.
   </p> 
   
   <p>
    The amount of time required to validate and resolve a reported vulnerability depends on the complexity
    and severity of the issue; and on the possible presence of third-party dependencies. Couchbase takes
    all reports seriously; prioritizes their investigation; and publicizes confirmed vulnerabilities 
    in the announcement forum, on the support knowledge-base.

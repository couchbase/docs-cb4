   <p><xref href="http://support.couchbase.com/home" format="html" scope="external">Submit a
     request</xref> or open a <xref href="http://issues.couchbase.com" format="html"
     scope="external">JIRA issue</xref>. The ticket number will become the reference identification

  <section><title>Providing Information</title>
   <p>All vulnerability reports should contain as much information as possible so that our engineers 
    can investigate the issue further. In particular, include the Common Vulnerability information, 
    if applicable, which includes:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Score.</li>
    <li>CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposures) Identifier.</li>
    <li>Contact information, including an email address and phone number, if applicable.</li>
   </ul>

  <section><title>Disclosure</title>
   <p>Couchbase, Inc. requests that you do <i>not</i> publicly disclose any information regarding
    the vulnerability or exploit the issue until Couchbase had the opportunity to analyze the
    vulnerability, to respond to the notification, and to notify key users, customers, and
    partners.</p> 
   <p>The amount of time to validate and resolve a reported vulnerability depends on the complexity
    and severity of the issue, and whether there are any third party dependencies. Couchbase takes
    all required vulnerabilities very seriously and will publicize confirmed security
    vulnerabilities in the announcement forum on the support knowledge base.</p>

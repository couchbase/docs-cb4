  <title>Certificate-Based Authentication</title>
  <body>
    <p>With the growing threat to security from rogue users and/or machines, password-based
      authentication is no longer a reliable method of authenticating users. Couchbase now supports
      the use of x.509 certificates to authenticate clients which ensures that only approved users
      (or machines or endpoints) are authenticated. Note that this authentication mechanism is
      available only for the data service. </p>
    <p>Certificate based authentication provides an additional layer of security. It relies on a
      certificate authority, CA, to validate identities and issue certificates. The certificate
      includes information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the
      name of the CA that issued the certificate, the digital signature of the issuing CA, and so
      on. This information serves as an introduction for users who know and trust the CA but donâ€™t
      know the entity identified by the certificate. All software that supports certificates
      maintain a collection of trusted CA certificates which help them determine which certificate
      issuers can be trusted. In cases where the CA is a part of a hierarchy, the software can
      verify that the certificate is signed by the same root CA. </p>
    <!--<p>The following diagram illustrates the SSL handshake when a certificate is used to identify a
      client. <image href="pict/ssl-handshake-cert-based.png" width="570"></image> </p>-->
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_zch_zwh_p1b">
        <li>When authenticating a client using x.509 certificates, Couchbase Server requests the
          client to present a client certificate during the handshake. </li>
        <li>When the client presents the certificate, the server checks for the validity of the
          certificate. </li>
        <li>If the certificate is valid and not expired, then it parses the certificate to obtain
          the user name specified in the certificate. </li>
        <li>The server then verifies the user and the roles assigned to the user. If the user has
          appropriate roles, then it authenticates the user and completes the handshake. </li>
        <li>If any of the checks fail, the handshake is not completed. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Since the identity in client certificates can be encoded in different ways for different
      kinds of users, Couchbase provides a flexible scheme to extract the identity from different
      certificates. Starting version 5.1, Couchbase Server supports multiple prefixes to be
      specified for client certificate authentication, as shown below. </p>
    <p>
      <codeblock>"client_cert_auth": {
  "state": "enable",
  "prefixes": [
    {
      "path": "san.dnsname",
      "prefix": "www.",
      "delimiters": ".,;"
     },
     {},
     ...
  ]
}</codeblock>
    </p>
    <p>The "prefixes" field is an array of <codeph>{<i>path</i>, <i>prefix</i>,
        <i>delimiters</i>}</codeph> tuples, where: <ul id="ul_qz3_rx5_zcb">
        <li><codeph><i>path</i></codeph> can be one of the following values:
            "<codeph>subject.cn</codeph>", "<codeph>san.uri</codeph>", "<codeph>san.email</codeph>",
            "<codeph>san.dns</codeph>"</li>
        <li><codeph><i>prefix</i></codeph> specifies the client certificate prefix value.</li>
        <li><codeph><i>delimiters</i></codeph> is a list of characters that can individually be
          treated as a delimiter</li>
      </ul></p>
    
    <p>The following constraints apply when specifying multiple tuples:<ul id="ul_yfv_hx5_zcb">
        <li>You can specify up to a maximum of 10 <codeph>{path, prefix,delimiters}</codeph> tuples
          in the "prefixes" array.</li>
        <li>No two tuples can have the same "<codeph><i>path</i></codeph>" and
              "<codeph><i>prefix</i></codeph>" fields. </li>
        <li>All the fields in the tuple must be specified. </li>
      </ul></p>

          <li>x.509 certificate is the official standard for public key certificates and SSL/TLS
            relies on this standard. You must use valid x.509 certificates generated and signed by
            the same root certificate authority (CA). </li>
          <!--<li>An x.509 certificate needs to be installed on Couchbase Server (root CA public key,
            Server Public and Private key). See <xref
              href="security-x509certsintro.dita#topic_cfk_mhn_xv"/> for details.</li>
          <li>The Couchbase client needs to have a valid certificate signed by the same root CA. </li>-->
          <li>The x.509 certificates must be in PEM format. </li>
        </ul>
        <note>Your prior knowledge of TLS/SSL, PKI certificates including X.509 certificates, and
          Certificate Authorities (CAs) is assumed for this topic and describing them is beyond the

      <title>Enabling x.509 Certificate Based Authentication on the Server</title>
      <p>You can enable certificate based authentication on the server using REST API or CLI. </p>
      <p>This authentication mechanism is available only for the data service and can be used with
        SDK/clients as well. For query and other services, use the other supported authentication
        mechanisms.</p>
      <p><b>Using REST API</b></p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a data file containing the payload for your certificate authentication
            settings. For example, <codeph>cb-certauth-setting.json</codeph>:
            <codeblock>{
	"state": "enable",
	"prefixes": [{
			"path": "san.uri",
			"prefix": "www.",
			"delimiter": "."
		},
		{
			"path": "san.email",
			"prefix": "couchbase.",
			"delimiter": "."
		}
	]
}</codeblock></li>
          <li>Run the following command to enable x.509 certificate authentication on the
            server.<codeblock>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @cb-certauth-setting.json http://Administrator:password@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/clientCertAuth </codeblock></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>To retrieve the client certificate authentication settings, run the following command:
        <codeblock>curl -X GET  Administrator:password@localhost:8091/settings/clientCertAuth</codeblock><codeblock spectitle="Result">{"state":"enable","prefixes":[{"delimiter":".","path":"san.uri","prefix":"www."},{"delimiter":".","path":"san.email","prefix":"couchbase."}]}</codeblock></p>
      <p><b>Using CLI</b></p>
      <p>Use the <cmdname>couchbase-cli</cmdname>
        <xref href="../cli/cbcli/couchbase-cli-ssl-manage.html#couchbaseclisslmanage1.idm68744912" format="html"/>

      <p>After setting up the server side for client authentication, you should also assign the
        users to some roles on the server side. To do so:  <ol>
          <li>Create a user with authentication source (domain) 'Couchbase'. </li>
          <li>Ensure that this user is an internally managed user with a strong password. While the
            password is not used as part of the certificate based authentication, it is required if
            the user is trying to access the resources through the web console.</li>
        </ol></p>
      <p>For information on assigning roles to users, see <xref

    <section><title>Limitations</title>
      <p>Note the following limitations to the feature in the current release: <ul>
          <li>X.509 Certificate Based Authentication will only work for data service.</li>
          <li>For Couchbase Server 5.5, X.509 Certificate-based Authentication is suported
            by all SDK Clients. However, only the very latest versions support it - check the <xref
              href="https://developer.couchbase.com/server/other-products/release-notes-archives/java-sdk"
              scope="external" format="html">release notes</xref> for your SDK version.</li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Upgrade</title>
      <p>When upgrading from an earlier version to 5.5, the cluster will be in mixed mode and will
        return client certificate authentication settings in the older format until the cluster is
        completely upgraded. Once the cluster has been upgraded, any existing client certificate
        authentication settings from earlier versions will be automatically transformed into the new
        format. </p>

   Audit Targets
 </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    The <i>target</i> of a Couchbase Server audit is a JSON file; which is rotated after a configured 
    time interval, and whose location path is configurable. This section provides some examples of
    content-appearance.

      Audit Log Targets 
    </title>
    
    <p>
      Auditable events are captured in JSON files. A default file, named <codeph>audit.log</codeph> is
      always available; and logged events are written to this file. After an administrator-specified
      period &#8212; which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days &#8212; the default
      file is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
      A new, empty <codeph>audit.log</codeph> file is saved, and logged events continue to be written to
      this new file. (Note that rollover may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.)
      For instructions on configuring the file's <i>rotation time</i>, see
      <xref href="./security-auditing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Auditing</xref>.

   Audit Targets
 </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    The <i>target</i> of a Couchbase Server audit is a JSON file; which is rotated after a configured 
    time interval, and whose location path is configurable. This section provides some examples of
    content-appearance.

      Audit Log Targets 
    </title>
    
    <p>
      When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file,
      named <codeph>audit.log</codeph>. After an administrator-specified
      period &#8212; which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days &#8212; this
      file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding 
      to the time of saving.
      A new, empty <codeph>audit.log</codeph> file is
      created and saved when a new audit event is generated. Note that this <i>rotation</i> may happen earlier if the file 
      reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
      For instructions on configuring the file's <i>rotation time</i>, see
      <xref href="./security-auditing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Auditing</xref>.

  <title>Couchbase Passwords</title>
  <shortdesc>Use of passwords is an important security measure in Couchbase.</shortdesc><body>
   
   
    <p>Couchbase Server supports several passwords:</p>  
    <ul>
        <li>Administrative passwords for Couchbase administrators and LDAP administrators</li>
        <li>Bucket passwords to secure data access to each bucket</li>
        
    </ul>
     <p>As a security best practice, choose passwords that are strong and periodically updated:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Strong passwords should have at least seven (8) characters, consisting of letters (upper
        and lower case), digits, and special characters.</li>
      <li>Passwords should be rotated periodically based on organization's requirements.</li></ul>
    <p> You can reset any forgotten administrative passwords using the
        <codeph>reset_password</codeph> tool.</p>

 <title>Spatial views</title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server offers spatial views to query geo-spatial information.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  
  <p>A spatial view contains geometry data that can be queried to return information based on
   whether the recorded geometries exist within a given multidimensional range.</p>
  <p>Spatial views support a variety of different use cases including multidimensional analysis,
   geo-data, and a combination. When analyzing multidimensional data, spatial views can operate on
   numeric data and map categories to numbers. Spatial views support the GeoJSON format and allow
   bounding-box queries on complex geometries that are represented as points, line-strings, and
   polygons. Geospatial views also index arrays supporting flat, multidimensional arrays of min-max
   coordinates, and combination of arrays and GeoJSON objects</p>
  <p>Below is a spatial view written in JavaScript that emits GeoJSON within an array combined with
   document attributes.
   <codeblock>function (doc, meta) {
    if (doc.geo !== undefined and doc.updated !== undefined) {
        var geojson = {type: "Point", coordinates: [doc.geo.lon, doc.geo.lat]};
        // The `doc.updated` might be an ISO 8601 date like "2015-10-07T08:57"
        var date = Date.parse(doc.updated);

        //The GeoJSON object must be first element
        emit([geojson, date], doc.name);
    }
}</codeblock>

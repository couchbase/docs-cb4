 <title>Non-JSON Data</title>
 <shortdesc>Non-JSON data is data that can not be parsed as a JSON document and is stored as a binary copy.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>

   <p>Data that can not be parsed as JSON is always stored and returned as a binary copy of the
    information submitted to the database. 
    For example, if an image is stored, the returned data is an identical binary copy of the stored image. 
    The
    significance of the returned structure can be seen when editing the view via the Web Console.</p>
  
   <p>Non-JSON data is available as a base64 string during view processing. A non-JSON document can
   be identified by examining the <codeph>type</codeph> field of the metadata structure 
    as well as during view processing by using the <codeph>meta</codeph> object supplied to the 
    <codeph>map()</codeph> function.</p>
   
   <p>Non-JSON data can  be indexed through the views system by creating an index on the
    key data. This is useful when the document key is significant. For example,
    if you store information using a prefix to the key to identify the record type, you can
    create document-type specific indexes.</p>

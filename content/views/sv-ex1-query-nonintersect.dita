  <title>Querying on Non-intersect</title>
  <shortdesc>This query retrieves data based on the GeoJSON polygon example and on bounding box parameters that are within the query range.</shortdesc>
  <refbody>
    <section><title>Description</title>
      <p>Queries only filter on a bounding box level. This means that even if the actual geometry
        doesn't intersect the query ranges but its bounding box does, it is still included in the result. </p>

      <section><title>Example</title>
        <p>The following example is based on the GeoJSON polygon data and the associated spatial view function.</p>
        
        <p>Curl example:</p>
        <codeblock>curl http://10.5.2.54:8092/default/_design/areas/_spatial/locAndArea?start_range=[-84,29,null]&amp;end_range=[-72,37,null]</codeblock>

    <section><title>Response</title>
      
      <p>The response shows that the ranges don't intersect the polygon of the Bermuda Triangle, but its enclosing bounding
        box does which can be found in its key.</p>

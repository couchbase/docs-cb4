	<title>Hadoop Connector 1.2</title>
	<shortdesc>The Couchbase Hadoop Connector allows you to connect to Couchbase Server 2.5, 3.x, or 4.x;
		in order to stream keys into either Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Hive, for processing with
		Hadoop. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>If you have previously used <xref href="http://sqoop.apache.org" format="html" scope="external">Apache
				Sqoop</xref> with other databases, using the Couchbase Hadoop Connector should be straightforward:
			because it uses a similar command-line argument-structure (although some of the arguments themselves might seem
			slightly different, because Couchbase has a very different structure than does a typical
			RDBMS).</p>

		<p>The Couchbase Hadoop Connector has reached End-of-Life (EOL) support. We recommend existing Hadoop integrations to migrate to supported version of the <xref href="../kafka/kafka-intro.dita">Couchbase Kafka Connector</xref>. Additionally, the Couchbase Hadoop Connector is not compatible with Couchbase Server 5.x; because it relies on the TAP feed API which has been removed from Couchbase Server 5.x in favor of the DCP feed.</p>

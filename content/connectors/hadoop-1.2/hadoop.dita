	<conbody>
		<p>The Couchbase Hadoop Connector has reached End-of-Life (EOL) support. We recommend existing Hadoop integrations to migrate to a supported version of the <xref href="../kafka/kafka-intro.dita">Couchbase Kafka Connector</xref>. Additionally, the Couchbase Hadoop Connector is not compatible with Couchbase Server 5.x; because it relies on the TAP feed API which has been removed in Couchbase Server 5.x in favor of the DCP feed.</p>

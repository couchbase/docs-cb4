	Troubleshooting
</title>

<shortdesc>
	The most common problems that occur in the context of the Couchbase-Elasticsearch 
	data-replication system are <i>data-transfer failure</i> and <i>data-indexing failure</i>. 
	This section describes procedures whereby you can monitor system-health; determine
	causes of failure; and fix problems.

			Monitoring
		</title>
			
		<p>
			You should monitor all of the following:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Outbound XDCR operations</i>. In Couchbase Web Console, left-click on the <uicontrol>Data 
				Buckets</uicontrol> tab; then, left-click on the bucket-name; and finally, open the 
				<uicontrol>Outbound XDCR Operations</uicontrol> tab, which is located towards the bottom of the UI. 
				This provides statistics related to data replication to Elasticsearch, 
				including the rate of transfer:
				
				<p>
					<image id="outboundXDCRops" href="images/outboundXDCRops.png" align="left" width="320" />
				</p>
			<p>
				
				<!-- Vertical space -->
			
			</p>
			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<i>Log files</i>. The Elasticsearch Plug-in uses the same directory as file as Elasticsearch 
				itself; which is located under the Elasticsearch install directory, and named <codeph>logs</codeph>.
				
				<p>	
					<!-- Vertical space -->
				</p>
				
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<i>Document-counts</i>. The number of documents in Couchbase can be compared
				with the number in Elasticsearch. This assumes that Couchbase has a static
				number of items. To get the number for Couchbase, in the Couchbase Web Console,
				left-click on the <uicontrol>Data Buckets</uicontrol> tab; then, examine the figure for each bucket in
				the <uicontrol>Item Count</uicontrol> column. For example: 
				
				<p>
					<image id="itemCount" href="images/itemCount.png" align="left" width="240"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<!-- Vertical space -->
				</p>
					
				<p> 
					To get the number from Elasticsearch, send an HTTP request, formed as
					follows: 
				</p>
					
				<codeblock>curl http://<i>[elasticsearch_host]</i>:9200/<i>[index_name]</i>/couchbaseDocument/_count</codeblock>
				
				<p> A successful response might appear as follows: </p>
<codeblock>{
    "count":7303,"_shards":
        {
            "Total":5,"successful":5,"failed":0
    }
}</codeblock>
					<p> In this response, the count has the same value as the number of items shown
						in the Couchbase Web Console, indicating that all items have been
						successfully transferred and indexed.
					</p>
				</li>	
		</ul>

			Troubleshooting Data-Transfer Issues
		</title>
		
		<p>
			If, by means of the monitoring procedures described above, you find evidence of data-transfer failure,
			proceed as follows:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Check your version of Elasticsearch</i>. 
				
				<!-- Then, ensure, by means of the 
				Version Matrix (provided in the current document, in the 
				section <xref href="./install-and-config.dita" scope="local" format="dita" />) 
				that it corresponds to the appropriate 
				installed versions of the plug-in and Couchbase Server itself. --> Note that a plug-in 
				version-incompatibility may produce an error message such as the following:

			<codeblock>Attention - Failed to grab remote bucket info from any of known nodes</codeblock>				
			
			<p>	
			Additionally, the Elasticsearch head console may display an error message such as the following:
			</p>
			
			<codeblock>[2012-12-19 05:50:41758][WARN ][org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler]
Error for /pools/default/buckets java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:</codeblock>
			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<i>Check destination-cluster references</i>. If such references were created in Couchbase Web 
				Console, and the replication itself was created and started subsequently, IP addresses 
				potentially underwent change in the interim: this occurrence is especially likely if a 
				laptop is used as the administration-platform. 
			
			<p>
				In such a case, the following error appears in the Status area of the <uicontrol>Ongoing Replications</uicontrol>
				tab, on the <uicontrol>XDCR</uicontrol> view provided by Couchbase Web Console:
			</p>
				
				<codeblock>2013-01-28 15:07:10 - Error replicating vbucket 56: {badmatch, {error,all_nodes_failed, 
&lt;&lt;"Failed to grab remote bucket info from Any of known nodes"&gt;&gt;}}</codeblock>
				
				<p>
					To resolve the problem, check remote Elasticsearch references in XDCR, and correct 
					IP addresses where appropriate. 
				</p>
				
			</li>
				
		</ul>

		<title>
			Troubleshooting Indexing Issues
		</title>
		
		<p>
			If you find that Couchbase items do not get indexed, or that unexpected items appear in Elasticsearch 
			query-responses, proceed as follows:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Change the </i><codeph>refresh_interval</codeph><i>-setting to a reduced number of seconds</i>. See 
				<xref href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-update-settings.html" scope="external" format="html">Update Indices Settings</xref> 
				in the Elasticsearch online documentation.
				
				<p>
					<!-- Vertical space -->
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<i>Check Elasticsearch mappings</i>. Such mappings are automatically generated by default; 
				and this involves assumptions about data types and structures within the imported documents. 
				In consequence, objects may be omitted: for example, objects within an array. See 
				<xref href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html" scope="external" format="html">Mapping</xref>,
				in the Elasticsearch online documentation. 
				
				<p>
					<!-- Vertical space -->
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<i>Check documents, to ensure that all are well-formed JSON</i>. Note that whereas, when
				JSON is not well-formed, the plug-in both accepts binary data and logs error 
				messages, Elasticsearch itself <i>cannot index any such data</i>.
				
				<p>
					<!-- Vertical space -->
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

			Enabling Logging
		</title>
		
		<p>
			You can configure the Couchbase Transport logging facility by editing the file 
			<codeph>./config/logging.yml</codeph>, and adding the following lines to the logger section:
		</p>
		
			<codeblock>Transport.couchbase: TRACE com.couchbase: TRACE</codeblock>
			
		<p>
			For information, see
			<xref href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/logging.html" scope="external" format="html">Logging</xref>,
			in the Elasticsearch online documentation.

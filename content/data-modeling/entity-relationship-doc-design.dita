 <title>Entity Relationships and Document Design</title>
 <shortdesc>Logical data modeling starts with a decision on how to map your entities to documents. JSON documents provide great flexibility in mapping 1-to-1, 1-to-many or many-to-many relationships.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>At one end, you can model each entity to its own document with references to represent
   relationships. At the other end, you can embed all related entities into a single large document.
   However, the right design for your application usually lies somewhere in between. Exactly how you
   should balance these alternatives depends on the access patterns and requirements of your
   application. The topics <xref href="#concept_hgb_31r_dt/reference-vs-embed-docs" format="dita"/>
   and <xref href="modeling-relationships.dita#concept_ol2_khr_dt"/> present a detailed discussion
   of tools for representing relationships and best practices for each type of relationships.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that binary key-value data is better suited for modeling long, narrow
   and mostly uniform data, for example, temperature measurements from an instrument that is
   repeated every few seconds. However, as the sophistication of the entities, attributes and
   relationships increases (larger number of attributes per entity, multilevel, cascading
   relationships, and more) the benefits of JSON documents become much more significant.</p>
  <section id="reference-vs-embed-docs"><title>Referencing Versus Embedding Documents</title>
   <p>This section discusses the tools for representing relationships and best practices for each type of relationship.</p>
   <p><b>Referencing documents</b></p>
   <p>You can reference another document (or a binary value) using the item key. This is similar to
    normalization in relational terms. Referencing enables Couchbase Server to cache, store, and
    retrieve the documents independently. For example, with entities like "beers" and "breweries",
    you can store beers in a document of their own and reference breweries from the beer document
    with a <parmname>brewery_id</parmname> attribute.</p>
   <p>In relational databases referencing is expected and is the norm as embedding is not typically
    supported. In some NoSQL solutions, referencing is highly discouraged due to lack of support for
    JOINs and sub-queries. However, Couchbase Server with N1QL provides support for JOIN operators,
    set expressions and sub-queries so data modelers are free to choose referencing or embedding,
    whichever is the best option for their case, without complicating code development.</p>
   <p>Referencing can be beneficial in a numbers of cases: <ul>
    <li>Referencing is advantageous if related items are not frequently accessed together. Each
     separate document is independently cached in managed cache and can be independently sent over
     the network. For example, a beer document that contains an embedded brewery document is larger
     than a beer document that merely references the brewery document. When the beer document
     references the brewery document using a <parmname>brewery_id</parmname> attribute, less memory
     is required to maintain the beer document.</li>
    <li>Referencing can help with information consistency and update efficiency. If an update to the
     brewery document is issued, you need not update all the beers referencing that brewery.
     However, if the brewery document is embedded in the beer document, and there could be many
     beers embedding the same brewery, you must search and update all the beers that embed the
     targeted brewery. </li>
    <li>Referencing can optimize memory, storage, and replication as it prevents repetition of
     brewery attributes across many beers. Intra-cluster DCP replication and Cross Datacenter
     Replication (XDCR) do not have to communicate the brewery attributes every time a beer gets
     updated.</li>
   </ul></p>
   <p>Referencing also has downsides: <ul>
    <li>If related items are mostly used together, this could create unnecessary overhead and
     may complicate application coding. For example, even though the beer document may be in
     memory, brewery document may get ejected under memory pressure causing additional
     latency for operations referencing both beers and brewery. To retrieve or update related
     items, you may need to issue multiple operations causing multiple round trips. For
     example, with "brewery" document referencing "beer", adding a new "beer" requires an
     additional write to the referencing "brewery" document.</li>
    <li>Couchbase Server provides ACID properties on document operations addressing a single
     document. <ul>
      <li>A single document write is guaranteed to either fully succeed or fail.</li>
      <li>No operation can see a partially updated version of the document. </li>
      <li>If update operation is issued with durability requirements such as replicated
       durability (replicateTo) or persisted durability (persistTo flag), Couchbase Server
       guarantees the whole document will be durable. </li>
     </ul><p>Operations that require an update to beer and a brewery document cannot take
      advantage of ACID properties. For example, if brewery document is embedded in beer
      document and there could be many beers embedding the same brewery, you must search and
      update all the beers that embed the targeted brewery. However, this cannot be done in
      a single consistent operation.</p></li>
   </ul>

   <p><b>Embedding documents</b></p>
   <p>You can embed a document in another document by simply defining an attribute to be a document.
    This enables Couchbase Server to cache, store, and retrieve the complex document with embedded
    documents as a single piece. For example, "beers" entity can embed "breweries" by embedding an
    attribute called brewery in the beer document.</p>
   <p>In relational databases embedding is not typically supported. In other NoSQL solutions
    embedding is typically overemphasized as JOINs and sub-queries are not supported in the
    platforms and code development gets complicated with referencing. </p>
   <p>In Couchbase Server, N1QL provides support for JOINs and sub-queries so data modelers are free
    to choose the best option for their case without complicating code development. Embedding can be
    beneficial in a numbers of cases. Some of these are similar to the disadvantages of referencing. <ul>
     <li>Embedding can be advantageous when related items are frequently used together. Because
      multiple entities are contained in a single document, those entities are cached together in
      Couchbase Server managed cache and can be retrieved with a single operation, which eliminates
      the need for multiple round trips. </li>
     <li>Couchbase Server provides ACID properties on operations addressing a single document. <ul>
      <li>A single document write is guaranteed to either fully succeed or fail. </li>
      <li>No operation can see a partially updated version of the document. </li>
      <li>If an update operation is issued with durability requirements such as replicated
       durability (replicateTo) or persisted durability (persistTo flag), Couchbase Server
       guarantees the whole document will be durable.</li>
     </ul><p>Imagine an "order" document that embeds "order line items" document embedded in it.
      With both related entities in a single document, operations that are required to update both
      the order and the order line items can take advantage of a single write. The atomic write
      ensures that either the entire update is successful or none of the updates to the order or
      its line items is committed to the document.</p></li>
    </ul></p>
   <p>Embedding also has downsides: <ul>
    <li>Embedding can hinder information consistency and update efficiency across documents. If an
     update to the brewery document is issued, all the beers embedding the same brewery have to be
     updated to ensure all redundant copies of breweries are identical.</li>
    <li>Embedding results in replicated bytes and therefore uses extra memory and storage space
     because it requires repetition of brewery attributes across many beers. Intra-cluster
     replication (DCP) and Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) have to communicate the brewery
     attributes every time a beer gets updated.</li>
   </ul></p>
  </section>
  <section><p>It is important to note that you can use hybrid solutions. Embedding may be a great choice for
   relationships like "book" and "authors" where there are only a few authors. However, referencing
   may be a better way when you have "instruments" and "measurements" as the relationship. In this
   case there would be millions of measurements per instrument and embedding is not a good option.
   With Couchbase Server you, as a developer,  have full freedom to choose the best option for your
   application without compromising on application complexity.</p>
